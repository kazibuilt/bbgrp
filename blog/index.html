love to see the continuous community contributions with new additions to our [Medusa Plugin Library](https://medusajs.com/plugins/), new Admin translations, and new Starters and plugins being shared on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/medusajs). Recently, two of our [Medusa Experts](https://medusajs.com/experts/), [Rigby](https://rigby.pl/) and [Agilo](https://agilo.co/), also open-sourced some of the larger plugins they have developed. Check it all out below.\n\n## Medusa Admin translated into +20 languages\n\nThe amount of community language contributions has been exceptional since we [announced multi-language support in September](https://medusajs.com/blog/announcing-multi-language-support/). Medusa now supports over 20 languages, including English, French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Japanese, Chinese, and many more. [Check out all the translations](https://docs.medusajs.com/user-guide/tips/languages) or learn how you can [contribute to the translation efforts](https://docs.medusajs.com/contribution/admin-translations).\n\n## Medusa Custom Attributes Plugin\n\n[Viktor Holik](https://github.com/vholik) from the Medusa Expert partner, [Rigby](https://rigby.pl/), recently contributed a new [Custom Attributes Plugin](https://github.com/vholik/medusa-custom-attributes) that allows you to expand the current product attributes to include new ones specific to your use case, such as “furniture type” or “Year of production”. These custom attributes can be in the form of strings, numbers, booleans, or arrays.\n\nThe plugin has a UI allowing you to access all your custom attributes from a separate Custom Attributes page in your Medusa Admin. After creating a custom attribute, you can edit it for each product on the Product page using a [widget](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/widgets). The plugin is actively used in the vintage marketplace, [Patyna](https://medusajs.com/blog/patyna-vintage-marketplace/).\n\nRead more about the plugin in Viktor's blog posts around it, [part 1](https://medium.com/rigby-software-house/adding-custom-attributes-in-medusa-js-ba1af9f312bb) and [part 2](https://medium.com/rigby-software-house/introducing-custom-attributes-in-medusa-js-part-2-ui-8c1f111f8845).\n\n![](/images/cropped.png)\n\n## Medusa WordPress Plugin\n\n[Ante Primorac](https://github.com/anteprimorac) and [Anamarija Papić](https://github.com/anamarijapapic) from another Medusa Expert partner, [Agilo](https://agilo.co/), have built a new plugin named [MedusaWP](https://github.com/Agilo/medusawp). This plugin allows you to use [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) as a CMS with Medusa. It enables you to import various data from Medusa into WordPress, including products, collections, thumbnails, and more.\n\nThe plugin also offers an overview of your data health, identifying any sync errors, partially synced items, and successful synchs. It also includes a country switcher feature for stores with multiple regions, which updates cart regions based on the country code.\n\nAt last, the plugin provides a feature-rich set of functions for your WordPress theme. These include [medusa-react](https://docs.medusajs.com/medusa-react/overview) utility functions for calculating and formatting prices and amounts.\n\nYou can view the full plugin and its feature set within the [MedusaWP repo](https://github.com/Agilo/medusawp).\n\n![](/images/292096021-a4a7b8f5-5a2a-44ff-a5bf-bdbaa64a2111%20\\(1\\)%201.png)\n\n## Multi-platform starter templates for Medusa\n\n[Rodrigo Figueroa](https://github.com/bidah) developed a starter kit, [Universal Medusa](https://github.com/bidah/universal-medusa), that lets you create multi-platform storefronts using [Next.js](http://nextjs.org/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev/) with a Medusa backend.\n\nUniversal Medusa offers a comprehensive development setup that includes shared Tailwind CSS styles and components adapted for native mobile development using [Nativewind](https://nativewind.dev/). The starter mostly matches Medusa's previous feature set and design from the [Next.js Starter Template](https://medusajs.com/nextjs-commerce/).\n\nCheck out the [project’s website](https://universal-medusa-docs.vercel.app) to get started. Or check out Rodrigo’s latest [Mobile Medusa](https://github.com/bidah/mobile-medusa) starter for a React Native mobile starter.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; height: 700px; width: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/community-multi-platform-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/community-multi-platform.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\n## Medusa Admin mobile (beta)\n\n[Ragheb](https://github.com/mllrr96) is developing [Medusa Admin Mobile](https://github.com/mllrr96/Medusa-Admin-Flutter), a mobile-friendly Medusa Admin app for iOS and Android. This app is built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and comes in a [pre-compiled APK file](https://github.com/mllrr96/Medusa-Admin-Flutter/releases) for Android users. Although the app is in beta, it allows you to view and modify various aspects of your store, including settings, orders, products, customer information, discounts, gift cards, price lists, and more.\n\nThe latest version features a new look with material design and several themes. To try the application, visit the [Git repository](https://github.com/mllrr96/Medusa-Admin-Flutter), which provides all the steps to get started. Ragheb also encourages feedback either in the [project thread on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/876835651130097704/1149712066119217453) or in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mllrr96/Medusa-Admin-Flutter).\n\n![](/images/Untitled%20\\(12\\).png)\n\n## Ultimate Medusa Plugin (beta)\n\n[Kichou Nadir](https://github.com/raideno) is developing the [Ultimate Plugin](https://github.com/raideno/medusa-plugin-ultimate). This plugin provides a user interface for interacting with new entities added to your Medusa store. It allows you to create, edit, view, and delete documents associated with those entities directly within the Medusa Admin. For example, if you add a blog entity (database table, service, route, loader, etc.), the plugin will allow you to manage related documents for each blog post directly from the admin dashboard.\n\nRead more about the plugin in Kichou's [documentation](https://medusa-plugin-ultimate.raideno.xyz/). Please note that the plugin is still in beta mode.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/community-ultimate-medusa-plugin-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/community-ultimate-medusa-plugin.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\n## Let us know what you are building\n\nWe would love to hear about the cool projects you have created with Medusa.

The company started in 2013 and has since grown to serve a diverse market of private and B2B customers, such as architects, retailers, and designers. Today, more than 2,000 vendors use the platform to market their vintage furniture, from established wholesalers to local sellers.\n\nSupported by their implementation partner, [Rigby](https://rigby.pl/), Patyna migrated from WooCommerce to Medusa. With Medusa, Patyna has been able to experiment and build new features faster while spending less time on maintenance and debugging. Along with the migration, Patyna built an admin setup with multiple user types and accesses, custom category control, a mechanism for order splitting, and much more.\n\n\u003ccallout icon=\"lightBulbSolid\" button-label=\"Get started\" \nbutton-url=\"https://docs.medusajs.com/recipes/marketplace\"\u003e\n**Marketplace Recipe**\nSet up your own marketplace with Medusa. \u003c/callout\u003e\n\n## 34% traffic uplift and 30% shorter time to market\n\nPatyna's team originally built their marketplace using WooCommerce. However, they constantly faced two major challenges: site performance and the release speed of new features. The performance issues stemmed from the platform being bloated with plugins and hacky workarounds, adversely impacting page load time and causing crashes during traffic peaks. Furthermore, vendors experienced considerable load time when making updates to their stores.\n\nThe slow development velocity resulted from the team spending too much time on platform maintenance and debugging. The tightly intertwined logic in WooCommerce meant that overriding parts of the system and its plugins could cause problems elsewhere, making root causes hard to identify and debugging a laborious task.\n\nMedusa addressed both of these challenges. Its composable nature allowed Rigby to easily use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to build a custom and performant frontend, resulting in a 34% traffic increase two months after going live. By optimizing CI/CD pipelines, minimizing debugging and maintenance time, and enabling smoother implementation of custom functionality, Medusa reduced the time to market for new features by 30%. Especially the ability to rapidly build custom logic was something Rigby found unique about the Medusa framework.\n\n\u003cquote name=\"Jakub Zbąski\" title=\"Co-founder and CEO at Rigby\"\u003e\nWe looked into other solutions, but I do not think it would have been possible, even at the slightest part, with any of the existing open-source or SaaS solutions to get the same result.\n\u003c/quote\u003e\n\n## Custom marketplace functionalities and multiple accesses\n\nIn setting up their marketplace, Rigby aimed for simplicity in their stack using only a few external services. They used [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) to manage content data such as homepage images, text, and About pages. [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com) and [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) were used for marketing, [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) for application monitoring, and [OpenReplay](https://openreplay.com/) for user session recordings.![patyna-tech-stack](/images/tech%20stack.png)\n\nThe marketplace encompasses three user types: customers, vendors, and Patyna Admin. For vendors and Patyna Admin, Rigby created separate admin dashboards with unique access levels and control features.\n\n### Patyna Admin: Controlling the marketplace\n\nPatyna’s admin has a custom dashboard from where they can control the entire marketplace. They can view all products, orders, vendors, and customers across the platform. Additionally, it allowed the team to:\n\n*   **Create sales reports:** This allows Patyna to generate PDF reports with sales and margin overviews across all products and vendors.\n\n*   **Manage product attributes:** This enables Patyna to define both standard product attributes (e.g., date of production) and custom attributes per product category (e.g., \"Types of legs\" for sofas). These attributes are then filterable for customers on the marketplace and must be filled out by vendors when creating new products within a category.\n\n*   **Control discounts and gift cards:** This allows them to create special customer discount codes or gift cards that can be used across all vendors.\n\n### Vendors: Controlling their store operations\n\nVendors are limited to controlling and accessing orders, customers, and products related to their own stores. Additionally, Rigby built custom functionality for:\n\n*   **Self-pickup delivery:** This feature allows vendors to offer pickup options for their products, and they can then manually mark orders as collected in their admin dashboard upon customer pick-up.\n\n*   **Custom order splitting:** When customers purchase products from multiple vendors, the order is split under the hood, ensuring each vendor manages only their part while the customer sees it all as a single order.\n\n*   **'Classics' products:** Patyna has a unique section in their marketplace called 'Classics' for select iconic products. Vendors can propose products for this section directly in their admin dashboard, and the Patyna Admin then gets a chance to review the submissions afterward and approve them within their dashboard.\n\nBeing able to ship custom features faster has paid off. Patyna quickly saw a resurgence in vendor activity on the platform, and some vendors even expressed their satisfaction with the platform's improved usability, noting that they were now inclined to add more products to the new platform because of its improved usability and performance.\n\n![patyna-admin-overview](/images/admin-overview.png)\n\n## Cutting maintenance and debugging time in half\n\nFor Rigby, the case demonstrated the profound impact the Medusa framework could have on their development velocity. Patyna's team estimated that Medusa roughly halved the time spent on ongoing maintenance and debugging. The framework made it easier for the team to keep logs for debugging purposes while offering an overall better developer experience when implementing custom logic and functionality.\n\nDespite using various composable ecommerce frameworks in the past, Rigby's learnings from Patyna convinced them to commit to Medusa for the future. Today, Rigby is included in [Medusa's Expert list](https://medusajs.com/experts/) and has chosen Medusa as their framework for multiple other ecommerce cases. For them, the decisive factors for doubling down on Medusa were the developer experience and scalability.\n\n\u003cquote name=\"Jakub Zbąski\" title=\"Co-founder and CEO at Rigby\"\u003e\nThe whole developer experience was really awesome. From managing vast product listings to handling intricate vendor details, Medusa provided a robust and scalable solution.\n\u003c/quote\u003e\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/custom-documentation-tools.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/custom-documentation-tools.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/custom-documentation-tools.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Our Custom Tools for Great Documentation","theme":"light","headerOverlaysContent":false,"featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/custom-tools-65e3a100.png","altText":"Post thumbnail image","caption":""},"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","date":"2023-12-21","authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-eb2no2kx3.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-eb2no2kx3.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-eb2no2kx3.json"},"firstName":"Shahed ","lastName":"Nasser","role":"Role","image":{"url":"/images/27354907.jpeg","altText":"Person photo"},"type":"Person"}],"excerpt":"We created custom documentation tooling that helps us adopt a more docs-as-code approach","category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json"},"name":"Product","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"In 2023, we introduced many new features, architectural changes, and developer experience enhancements in Medusa. The latest of which is highlighted in our [Recap 3](https://medusajs.com/recap/) page.\n\nWe recognized the importance of making sure the documentation aligns with the core product at the same speed. We knew we had to enforce a docs-as-code approach further to do so. A docs-as-code approach encourages adopting processes, testing practices, and implementations with documentation typically used with code.\n\nAs a result, we've created a custom documentation toolkit that we use internally, ranging from low-level documentation generation tools to custom-built documentation websites.\n\nIn this article, I'll share with you some of the custom documentation tools we built in 2023 at Medusa and some of the plans we have to continue improving our documentation.\n\n## Why Build Custom Tools\n\nPreviously, our documentation was built using tools like Docusaurus and Redocly. Our team manually wrote the content within the documentation as Markdown files within the Docusaurus codebase.\n\nWhile this setup worked initially, it was only a short time until Medusa outgrew it. The quick pace of releases made information in the documentation stale; the large number of API routes slowed down the API Reference; introducing new features like [Modules](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/overview) and [Workflows](https://medusajs.com/blog/announcing-medusa-workflows-sdk/) raised the need for understandable and easy-to-use references.\n\nOur documentation tools weren't enough anymore. So, we started building a documentation toolkit to resolve our problems and improve the developer experience in our documentation.\n\n## Custom REST API Reference\n\nPreviously, our REST API Reference website was built using Redocly as part of our main documentation website, built with Docusaurus. While Redocly is a great tool for building an API reference website, we had performance issues due to our wide-reaching commerce API Routes and information within each of those routes.\n\nWe explored different existing options, but none satisfied our use case. As a result, we decided to build a [custom API Reference website](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store) from scratch.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/api-reference-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/api-reference.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\nThe website is built with Next.js 14, and documentation for Medusa’s API Routes is loaded on demand, improving the website's overall performance. Our designer also created a fresh and clean design for the new API reference.\n\nYou can check out the source code [here](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/tree/develop/www/apps/api-reference).\n\n## References Generator\n\nAfter introducing the [Product](https://docs.medusajs.com/experimental/product/overview) and [Pricing](https://docs.medusajs.com/experimental/pricing/overview) Modules, we wanted to provide a clear API reference in our documentation for the main interface of each module. We also wanted to improve our existing references, such as the JS Client reference.\n\nTo do that, we used [Typedoc](https://typedoc.org/), a tool that generates documentation from comments in TypeScript source code, with existing and custom plugins relevant to our use case. Some of the plugins we built were:\n\n*   A plugin that converts OpenApi Specification (OAS) schemas to their equivalent TSDoc comments. This is especially useful for our JS Client reference as we can reuse the same request and response type details used for the REST API Reference.\n\n*   A plugin that uses ESLint to lint code examples in the TSDoc comments.\n\n*   A plugin that allows injecting custom frontmatter into Markdown files.\n\n![](/images/references-generation.jpg)\n\nThis also allowed us to bring the documentation close to the code, which:\n\n*   Mitigates information staleness: as members of our engineering team make changes to the code, they can directly reflect the changes on the documentation in the code's doc-block.\n\n*   Improves code readability and maintainability.\n\n*   Provides better auto-complete descriptions during development.\n\nThis encouraged us to move more of our documentation pages to live closer to the code, which is still ongoing.\n\n## Coming Soon: Workflows Diagram Generator\n\nIn [Recap 3](https://medusajs.com/recap/), we introduced Workflows. A workflow is a series of steps that complete a task and can be executed from anywhere. Aside from providing the necessary documentation for Workflows, we also wanted to visualize workflows in the documentation for a better developer experience.\n\nSo, we built a tool that creates [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams of workflows used in the Medusa backend, which can be visualized in the documentation.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/workflows-diagram-generator-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/workflows-diagram-generator.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\nWhile we still need to incorporate it in our documentation, we've built the necessary foundation of this tool to make it possible and look forward to adding it to our documentation soon.\n\nYou can check out the source code [here](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/tree/develop/docs-util/packages/workflows-diagrams-generator).\n\n## UI Props Generator\n\nIn 2023, we introduce [Medusa UI](https://docs.medusajs.com/ui), a package of UI components that implement the Medusa design system and allow developers to build customizations in the admin with a consistent design.\n\nIn the [Medusa UI documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/ui), we show the props that each component accepts. To ensure that these props remain up-to-date, we created a tool that generates JSON spec files for each component from the source code.\n\nThese spec files are then loaded in the Medusa UI documentation website, built on Next.js 14, to display the component's details and props.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot%202023-12-13%20at%207.50.18%E2%80%AFPM.png)\n\nThis tool is built on top of [react-docgen](https://react-docgen.dev/), which extracts details of React components and generates JSON documentation, and Typedoc. As we faced some limitations with `react-docgen`, we customized its handlers and resolvers to ensure that all props and components were recognized and used Typedoc to fill in any missing details.\n\nYou can find the source code of the tool [here](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/tree/develop/docs-util/packages/react-docs-generator).\n\n## Generate Documentation on Release\n\nBuilding the tools is one thing, but another important aspect is ensuring the documentation is updated whenever there's a new Medusa release.\n\nSo, we've added GitHub actions that run whenever a new release is published, making documentation updates part of the release pipeline.\n\n![](/images/release-process.jpg)\n\nThis GitHub action checks for any updates in the REST APIs, UI props, and general references and opens a pull request with the updates, eliminating the need to make the updates manually.\n\n## Notable Documentation Improvements\n\nAside from the custom documentation toolkit, we've continued improving our documentation to provide a better developer experience. The improvements include:\n\nAdded a Recipes section in our documentation, with guided learning paths that you can start and finish at your own pace.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/learning-path-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/learning-path.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\nAn enhanced search experience with intuitive navigation.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/search-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/search.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\nAn AI Assistant to provide help during your learning journey.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/ai-assistant-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/ai-assistant.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\n## Future of Docs at Medusa\n\nThere are still many more improvements to be made both for our documentation and its underlying tooling and processes. Also, since Medusa’s features now make it suitable for orchestration tooling, developers need to understand Medusa as a framework, which requires building a learning path that teaches Medusa’s concepts from end to end.\n\nWhile it's difficult to list all of the documentation plans, some of the ideas we have for the near future include:\n\n*   Improved documentation structure with better learning paths and guidance.\n\n*   Interactive API reference and UI documentation.\n\n*   Better feedback collection from users to keep improving our documentation and core product.\n\nIf you have any ideas for improvements and new features or find bugs in our documentation, please share them with us on [GitHub](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa), [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp), or our social channels.\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/announcing-improved-subscriber-api.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/announcing-improved-subscriber-api.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/announcing-improved-subscriber-api.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Announcing Improved Subscriber API","theme":"light","headerOverlaysContent":false,"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","date":"2023-11-27","authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-5u6je47u2.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-5u6je47u2.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-5u6je47u2.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Kasper","image":{"url":"/images/Kasper.webp","altText":"Person photo"},"lastName":"Kristensen","role":"SW Engineer"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json"},"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Juhl","role":"CTO \u0026 Co-founder","image":{"url":"/images/oli.jpeg","altText":"Oliver Juhl"},"type":"Person","bio":"CTO \u0026 Co-founder of Medusa\n"}],"excerpt":"Our improved Subscriber API allows developers to run logic in response to events in Medusa using simple JavaScript functions.","category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json"},"name":"Product","type":"Category"},"featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/subscriber.png","altText":"altText of the image","caption":"Caption of the image","objectPosition":"50% 50%","objectFit":"cover","elementId":"","height":0,"width":0},"markdown_content":"We care deeply about developer experience across all our products. Our primitives and tooling allow developers to effortlessly build digital commerce applications at record speed.\n\nToday, we are excited to announce a massive update to our Subscriber API that significantly improves the developer experience of a core concept in Medusa’s customization toolbox.\n\n## Subscribers\n\nServices in Medusa emit events whenever actions like creating and updating records occur. Subscribers in Medusa provide a way for developers to run asynchronous logic in response to these events. This could include syncing a product to an external service when it is updated in Medusa or applying a special discount when a set of specific products is added to a cart.\n\nWith our updated API, you can create subscribers using a pattern similar to how you build API Routes.\n\n\u003ccodeblock language=\"ts\"\u003e\n```\n// src/subscribers/order-placed.ts\nexport default async function ({ data, container }) {\n    const { id } = data\n\n    const slackService = container.resolve(\"slackService\")\n    const orderService = container.resolve(\"orderService\")\n\n    const order = await orderService.retrieve(id)\n\n    await slackService.sendNotis({ data: order })\n}\n\nexport const config: SubscriberConfig = {\n    event: OrderService.Events.PLACED,\n}\n```\n\u003c/codeblock\u003e\n\nExample of a Subscriber\n\nThe example above illustrates a few key points of the updated Subscriber API:\n\n*   Exports from files in `/subscribers` control the behavior of your event handlers. The default export is a function with the logic to run, and the `config` export specifies the event that logic should be run in response to\n\n*   The handler accepts an argument of type `SubscriberArgs`. This can be de-structured to access the event data and the Medusa container.\n\nIn the example above, we register a handler that is run every time the product updated event is triggered.\n\nThe new approach to registering subscribers also comes with the benefit of making it easier than ever to set up a handler for multiple events. The `event` field in the config accepts either a single event or a list of events. Continuing with the above example, it would be possible to update the handler to update the external system when a product is created, updated, and deleted.\n\n```ts\n// src/subscribers/product-sync.ts\nimport { syncProductsWorkflow } from \"../workflows\"\n\nexport default async function ({ data, eventName, container }) {\n  await syncProductsWorkflow.run({ input: data })\n}\n\nexport const config: SubscriberConfig = {\n  event: [\n\t\tProductService.Events.CREATED,\n\t\tProductService.Events.UPDATED,\n\t\tProductService.Events.DELETED\n\t]\n}\n```\n\nBy updating the `event` field and adding a few additional lines of code, the handler can now process all relevant events. This keeps the external system synchronized with Medusa.\n\n## What is next?\n\nWe are excited to hear your thoughts about our new Subscriber API.

A key challenge is to ensure these systems work together to complete the tasks that drive your business forward. We are, therefore, incredibly excited to announce the beta release of Medusa Workflows, a new, powerful primitive in the Medusa toolbox to help build custom business flows involving multiple systems.\n\nMedusa’s Workflows SDK enables developers to write critical business flows with a simple DX and a strong foundation. Workflows have built-in retry and rollback mechanisms, which make them resilient to intermittent failures and a great place to define your commerce stack’s integrations and customizations.\n\nMedusa Workflows are not dependent on Medusa’s commerce modules. You can start using them to integrate your commerce stack regardless of what ecommerce platform you are on, giving you access to Medusa’s powerful customization tools without needing to migrate your commerce platform.\n\n## Build a Workflow\n\nBuilding Workflows is like writing JavaScript functions, but unlike regular functions, the Workflows SDK creates an internal representation of your Workflow to keep track of its progress, retry failing steps, and roll back operations if necessary.\n\n### Define a Workflow Step\n\nTo create a Workflow, you first define a Workflow Step using the Workflows SDK’s `createStep` function.\n\n```ts\nimport { createStep, StepResponse } from \"@medusajs/workflows-sdk\"\n\nconst reserveInventory = createStep(\"reserve-inventory\", async (cart, context) =\u003e {\n    const inventoryService = context.container.resolve(\"inventoryService\");\n    await inventoryService.reserveInventory(cart.items);\n    return new StepResponse({ success: true });\n  }\n);\n```\n\nThe above step resolves an Inventory Service from the dependency injection container and reserves inventory for items in a Cart. Note that the step takes a Cart as input and responds with a StepResponse. The StepResponse can be used in subsequent steps.\n\n### Create a Workflow\n\nOnce your step is created, you can use it within a Workflow. To construct a Workflow you use the `createWorkflow` helper from the Workflows SDK.\n\n```ts\nimport { createStep, StepResponse, createWorkflow } from \"@medusajs/workflows-sdk\"\n\nconst reserveInventory = createStep(\"reserve-inventory\", async (cart, context) =\u003e {\n  const inventoryService = context.container.resolve(\"inventoryService\");\n  await inventoryService.reserveInventory(cart.items);\n  return new StepResponse({ success: true });\n});\n\nconst acceptQuoteWorkflow = createWorkflow(\"accept-quote\", function (input) {\n  const cart = retrieveCart(input.cartQuoteId);\n  reserveInventory(cart);\n  authorizePayment(cart);\n  createOrder(cart);\n});\n```\n\nThe above Workflow accepts a quote shared with a customer, and the step we created to reserve inventory is used as part of the Workflow. In the Workflow, we have used our `reserveInventory` Workflow Step.\n\nThe function passed to `createWorkflow` is used to generate a representation of the Workflow logic and map the data dependencies between steps. For example, the Workflow SDK knows that `reserveInventory` step needs the output of `retrieveCart` as its input. This enables Medusa to automatically retry a step if it fails and only progress when possible and allowed. If a step fails more than a configurable number of times, Medusa will automatically roll back previous steps.\n\n### Defining compensating actions\n\nLet’s define the compensation for our `reserveInventory` step. We do this by specifying what data our step will need to roll back in the StepResponse and a compensation function to execute when rolling back.\n\n```ts\nimport { createStep, StepResponse } from \"@medusajs/workflows-sdk\"\n\nconst reserveInventory = createStep(\"reserve-inventory\", async (cart, context) =\u003e {\n    const inventoryService = context.container.resolve(\"inventoryService\");\n    await inventoryService.reserveInventory(cart.items);\n    return new StepResponse({ success: true }, cart.items);\n  },\n  async (items, context) =\u003e {\n    const inventoryService = context.container.resolve(\"inventoryService\");\n    await inventoryService.releaseInventory(items);\n  }\n);\n```\n\nNote that the StepResponse now specifies the `cart.items` as rollback data. This is then used in the compensation function to release the inventory.\n\n### Triggering a Workflow\n\nYou can execute a Workflow from different places within Medusa. For example, you may use API Routes if you want the workflow to execute in response to an API request or a webhook. Subscribers if you want to execute a workflow when an event is triggered. Or Scheduled Jobs if you want your workflow to execute regularly.\n\nHere’s an example of executing a Workflow in an API Route. You can learn about more ways of triggering Workflows in our docs.\n\n```ts\n// src/api/quotes/accept/route.ts\n\nimport { acceptQuoteWorkflow } from \"@/workflows\"\n\nexport async function POST(req, res) {\n  const workflow = acceptQuoteWorkflow(req.scope)\n\n  await workflow.run({\n    cartQuoteId: req.cart_id\n  })\n\n  res.json({ accepted: true })\n}\n```\n\n## What can you use Workflows for?\n\nMedusa Workflows are especially good for orchestrating multiple tools to achieve a task. Integrating systems in your stack using Workflows, for example, ensures that data is kept consistent and that unexpected errors are handled gracefully. To build an integration with Workflows, you would create a custom Medusa service connecting to your 3rd party system. The custom service can then be resolved in your steps to execute actions.\n\nThe more systems you integrate with Medusa, the more Workflows you can create to automate your operations and push your customer experience forward. Consider the example of integrating purchase orders from your ERP system with inbounds in your WMS system. With a Medusa connection to your ERP and WMS, you can easily map the purchase order flow and other ERP to WMS flows. Additionally, because you have other connections - like your product information - available, you can leverage those in your Workflows. For example, you can quickly configure your purchase order Workflow to record the expected restock date of your products to display to customers.\n\n![](/images/Untitled%20\\(8\\)-65817d5b.png)\n\n### Long-running workflows (coming soon)\n\nWith the initial beta release, Workflows can run exclusively in-band. We will soon add support for long-running Workflows that include asynchronous operations or human-in-the-loop steps. This opens further use cases for Workflows. For example, you can build a Workflow to manage the preparation of new products for sale. The Workflow starts when a product is inbounded at your warehouse. Then, tasks can kick off for taking pack shots, writing titles and descriptions, translating copy, and merchandizing the product. As each task is completed, the Workflow can proceed. All tasks would be mapped as Workflow Steps and could be completed in systems across your stack. If a task fails to complete or a configurable timeout is reached, rollback logic can help keep your data consistent, or notify responsible parties.\n\n![](/images/long-running%20\\(1\\).png)\n\n## Core Workflows\n\nWorkflows are a key part of our efforts toward shipping Medusa 2.0. With Medusa 2.0, we are decoupling most of Medusa’s internal services and bringing them to standalone packages available on npm. This means you can use Medusa’s services, like Products, Pricing, Carts, etc., independently from the rest of Medusa. We will continue to offer Medusa’s powerful and customizable commerce API in a way that’s easy to install with `npx create-medusa-app`. For each default API endpoint, there will be an available core Workflow to do things like creating products, adding to cart, applying discounts, and much, much more. The core Workflows will orchestrate Medusa (or custom) modules and be extensible. This does two things:\n\n1.  It makes Medusa pluggable - you can use any provider to handle Products, Carts, Discounts, etc. The Workflow will call the provider when it needs to.\n\n2.  You will get a new and easy way to extend business logic by injecting custom code into Workflows. There is no need to modify core services or override default endpoints; the Workflow will ensure your custom logic is called when required.\n\nCore Workflows are introduced incrementally behind the `medusa_v2` feature flag, and more and more Workflows become available as we ship new Commerce Modules.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nThe Workflows SDK joins Custom Entities, Services, API Routes, Subscribers, and Cron Jobs in the Medusa toolbox. With Workflows, Medusa provides a primitive for building custom business flows spanning multiple systems. It has built-in failure handling and rollback logic to ensure your critical Workflows run smoothly and your data is kept consistent. You can start using the Workflows SDK without migrating to Medusa’s commerce modules, making it an excellent tool for integrating your digital commerce stack and building customizations for customer experiences and internal operations.\n\nVisit [our docs](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/workflows) to get started with Workflows.

The Pricing Module ships as an npm package that can be installed in any Node project requiring advanced pricing logic and is integrated into Medusa experimentally behind the `medusa_v2` feature flag as part of our efforts to [release Medusa 2.0](https://medusajs.com/blog/toward-medusa-2/).\n\nIn Medusa, the Pricing Module is used to set prices for Product Variants conditional on currencies, regions, customer groups, sales channels, and more. You can read more about the Pricing Module functionality [here](https://medusajs.com/pricing-module/). Now, the Pricing Module’s logic works entirely independently and can be used to configure prices for anything specific to your needs.\n\nThe Pricing Module has two key functionalities:\n\n1.  Creating a set of prices for a resource with pricing rules governing when each is applicable.\n\n2.  Choosing the correct price to use given a context.\n\n## Using the Pricing Module\n\nImagine you want to differentiate the prices of tickets to a tech conference based on the customer’s location. You want to offer cheaper tickets to local companies. With the Pricing Module you first configure your pricing rules:\n\n```ts\nconst myTicketPriceSet = await pricingModuleService.create({\n  rules: [{ rule_attribute: \"city\" }],\n  prices: [\n    { amount: 1000, currency_code: \"usd\", rules: {} },\n    { amount: 500, currency_code: \"usd\", rules: { city: \"New York\" } },\n  ]\n})\n```\n\nThe above code returns a PriceSet to associate with your ticket.\n\nThe Pricing Module provides a `calculatePrices` function to get the correct price to charge a customer. Before calling the function you will collect the city your customer is in; for example, based on the IP address, and pass it as context `calculatePrices`.\n\n```ts\nconst [priceToCharge] = await pricingModuleSerivce.calculatePrice(\n\t{ id: [priceSet.id] },\n\t{ context: { currency_code: \"usd\", city: \"New York\" } }\n)\n\npriceToCharge // { calculated_price: 500, currency_code: \"usd\" }\n```\n\nYou can configure as many rules as you need, and the Pricing Module will always provide the correct price to your customer, considering things like overlapping applicability and rule priorities.\n\n## Serverless support\n\nThe Pricing Module is ready for serverless environments, making it possible to run price calculations from tools like Lambda, Vercel, or Netlify Functions. To use the Pricing Module in a serverless function, initialize the Pricing Module with the initialize function.\n\n```ts\n// my-next-app/app/api/price/route.ts\n\nimport { initialize } from \"@medusajs/pricing\"\nimport { headers } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport async function GET(req, res) {\n  const headers = headers()\n  const ipCity = headers.get(\"x-vercel-ip-city\")\n\n  const pricingModule = await initialize({ /* db credentials here */ })\n  const [price] = await pricingModule.calculatePrices(\n\t\t{ id: [priceId] }, \n\t\t{ context: { currency_code: \"usd\", city: ipCity } }\n\t)\n\n\tres.json({ price: price.calculated_amount })\n}\n```\n\nWith serverless support you can offer your customers fast and highly personalized experiences.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nAt Medusa, we build tools for developers to create custom digital commerce applications. The Pricing Module is another step toward preparing Medusa for version 2.0.

For example, you can push daily updates to an external ERP system or generate weekly sales reports.\n\nWith the new Scheduled Jobs API, setting up recurring tasks can be achieved with only a few lines of code with a syntax that is familiar to any JavaScript developer.\n\n```\n// src/jobs/daily-erp-update.ts\nimport { ProductService, ScheduledJobsConfig, ScheduledJobsArgs } from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\nimport ErpService from \"../services/erp\"\n\nexport default async function ({ container }: ScheduledJobsArgs) {\n\tconst productService: ProductService = container.resolve(\"productService\")\n\t// Service for interacting with external ERP system\n\tconst erpService: ErpService = container.resolve(\"erpService\")\n\t\n\tconst products = await productService.listAndCount()\n\n\tawait erpService.update(products)\n}\n\nexport const config: ScheduledJobsConfig = {\n  name: \"daily-erp-update\",\n\tschedule: \"0 0 * * *\" // At 00:00 every night\n}\n```\n\nThe above example illustrates a few key points of how to use the new Scheduled Jobs API:\n\n*   Exports from files in `/jobs` control the behavior of the action performed in your task. The default export is a function with the logic to run, and the config specifies the name and schedule of the task.\n\n*   The handler is a function that gets invoked each time the job runs. In the given example, it lists products in Medusa and forwards them to the ERP system.\n\n*   The config assigns a name to the job and sets the schedule for the job. In the provided example, the schedule is set to repeat the job every night at 00:00.\n\nYou can read more about the new API [in our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/scheduled-jobs/overview).\n\nWe are excited to hear your thoughts about our new Scheduled Jobs API.

We thought it deserved some love, so the Starter just got a big update with a complete design overhaul, Medusa UI components, Next.js 14, and better product search.\n\nThe goal of the Starter is to provide a foundation for developers to build on. It consists of a fully functional ecommerce frontend, already connected to a Medusa backend. We aimed for a design that is fresh but neutral so you can easily customize it to fit your brand.\n\n## Medusa UI Support\n\nWe redesigned the Starter to work with [Medusa UI](https://docs.medusajs.com/ui) components and icons. This results in a fresh, recognizable design language and components that allow for easy customization.\n\nMedusa UI is a React implementation of the Medusa design system. The collection includes components, hooks, utility functions, icons, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes. It's designed for building a consistent user interface across Medusa Admin and other Medusa applications.\n\n## Ready for Medusa 2.0\n\nWhile we [work toward Medusa 2.0](https://medusajs.com/blog/toward-medusa-2/), you can already try out some of our cutting-edge serverless modules with the Next.js Starter. The Starter has support for both the [Product](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/products/serverless-module) and the Pricing module, as well as Remote Query to build your own serverless product endpoints. If you’re feeling adventurous, you can enable these experimental features by enabling the `MEDUSA_FF_MEDUSA_V2` feature flag in both the Starter and the server.\n\n## New design showcase\n\n### Home\n\nThe homepage has been cleaned up and now shows featured product collections.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot%202023-11-23%20at%2009.43.56-12d8a5f8.jpg)\n\n### Product detail page\n\nThe product detail page has a new layout and now uses Medusa UI components.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot%202023-11-23%20at%2009.43.45.jpg)\n\n### Product overview page\n\nThe product overview page has been redesigned and now features sorting out of the box.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot%202023-11-23%20at%2009.45.30.jpg)\n\n### Product search\n\nThe Starter already supported Algolia and MeiliSearch out of the box, but now has a revamped instant search UI and a server-rendered search results page.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot%202023-11-23%20at%2009.46.41.jpg)\n\n### Cart\n\nThe new cart design is built almost exclusively from Medusa UI components.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot%202023-11-23%20at%2009.47.51.jpg)\n\n### Checkout\n\nThe redesigned checkout process provides a streamlined experience, making it easier than ever for customers to finalize their purchases.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot%202023-11-23%20at%2009.50.39.jpg)\n\n### Get started with Next.js and Medusa\n\nSee the full new design in action in our [updated hosted demo](https://next.medusajs.com/).\n\nWant to build with the Starter yourself?

Often, these are e-commerce sites, but they can also be [marketplaces](https://medusajs.com/blog/foraged-custom-marketplace/), [enterprise OMS systems](https://medusajs.com/blog/makro-omnichannel-order-orchestration/), [B2B commerce platforms](https://medusajs.com/blog/visionary-b2b/), and much more. When we started Medusa, we wanted to build something to avoid the frustrating and painful hacky workarounds we had encountered with other commerce platforms. And now, thousands of companies are using Medusa, including fast-moving startups and some of the world’s largest companies. It’s hard to explain how happy and proud we are to share our work with you, and our top priority continues to be improving your experience.\n\n## Taming complexity in your stack\n\nCompanies reach for Medusa to manage complex workflows that SaaS providers and other open-source tools can’t handle. Examples of complexity we have seen include gathering customer data across different channels to deliver personalized experiences. Or fulfilling thousands of daily orders from hundreds of distribution centers in the way that best aligns with business strategies. Or creating a seamless B2B purchasing experience for highly configurable products. The complexity companies experience is especially common when multiple systems have to work together to deliver a customer experience or automate a business flow.\n\nMany companies try to tame their complexity by building applications from scratch that tie systems together and define customizations; however, building the foundation for such applications takes focus from serving customers best. Medusa has proven to be a much better starting point for businesses to accomplish their customizations than anywhere else. Medusa already has standards for defining data models, custom business logic, and much more, all while being flexible and easy to work with. Instead of reinventing these standards, Medusa users can focus on defining the logic that gives customers the best experience and optimizes operations.\n\n## Build custom digital commerce applications faster\n\nMedusa 2.0 doubles down on ensuring Medusa is the best foundation for building custom digital commerce applications. This is achieved through a focus on supporting custom workflows involving multiple systems directly in Medusa. Today's digital commerce happens with help from different systems, whether point solutions, marketing tools, ERP systems, or custom-built internal systems. With many tools in a stack, a key challenge becomes aligning them and making them work together. Most tools and services have APIs and say they are composable. But they can merely only participate in a composable stack. No tool, except Medusa, helps businesses easily build the foundation for such a stack. And with Medusa 2.0, we will continue to make this much easier.\n\nTwo key changes in Medusa’s architecture will address this:\n\n1.  We will make core commerce concepts like Products, Discounts, etc., pluggable so you can use Medusa’s APIs without necessarily having to use Medusa’s full commerce module suite.\n\n2.  We will launch a new, powerful Workflow primitive to orchestrate modules and services to complete tasks in your digital commerce stack.\n\nThe outcome is that Medusa becomes a hub where your company’s systems can interact. With Medusa’s customization tools, it will be straightforward to build integrations, customer experiences, or internal business workflows from that central hub.\n\n## Making Medusa's modules pluggable\n\nMedusa's architecture has, from the beginning, been modular. The main Medusa package ships with a service for handling products, another for handling carts, another for handling discounts, and so on. The services provide great separation of concerns and make it easy to use them in customizations. All services, however, must run within the same server and database. This is not bad in itself, but it requires that Medusa stores a copy of your data from across your tools internally to make its features work. We are eliminating this dependency and thereby making Medusa pluggable with existing tools.  For example, if you have product data in an existing PIM system, you can integrate it deeply with Medusa. When a customer adds a product to their cart, we will fetch product information directly from the PIM system, and you can set up tax and discount rules for the products despite them not being part of Medusa's database.\n\n![](/images/old-new.jpg)\n\nWe are moving services into standalone packages like `@medusajs/product` and `@medusajs/pricing` to achieve this. These modules work independently of the rest of Medusa and can be used within any Node environment, including compatible serverless runtimes. Simultaneously, within the Medusa package, we are defining interfaces to the modules to make Medusa's default API work with the new standalone modules. This work happens behind the `medusa_v2` feature flag.\n\n## New primitives for building digital commerce flows\n\nSoon, we will introduce Workflows -  a new, powerful primitive for digital commerce applications with Workflows. A Workflow is a sequence of queries and actions across your system that achieve a task. Medusa will ship a wide range of Workflows to create products, add to a cart, and other operations available in Medusa’s API today.\n\nWorkflows are customizable, so you can inject custom logic into core workflows. For example, you can run custom validation when customers update their shipping addresses. Or add rules governing who can add given products to a cart. Or create a product entry in your CMS system whenever a new product is created.\n\nGiven that Medusa may be mutating data in external systems - like a PIM for your product data - we are building error handling into Workflows. Medusa will automatically retry failed attempts to update data, and if the issue is permanent, Medusa’s Workflows will compensate for any previous data changes that may have happened.\n\n![](/images/add-to-cart.jpg)\n\nDevelopers will also be able to create custom Workflows, which opens the door for a broad range of use cases and makes Medusa the best place to build integrations between your systems.\n\nConsider integrating purchase orders from your ERP with your warehouse management system's inbounds. You can easily build custom services for your ERP and WMS and then construct a workflow that processes the purchase order and forwards it to the WMS. Doing this through Medusa creates opportunities for better customer experiences, like decorating products with an expected restock date for your customers to know when their favorite product will become available. This is easy because your product data is readily available through Medusa. Additionally, with the workflows, you won't have to worry about stale data between systems as retries and compensations are built-in. This is just one example of how custom Workflows can be used. As you add more connections between systems in your stack and Medusa, the opportunities for what is possible with Workflows expand exponentially.\n\n![](/images/medusa-connecter-76bb3996.jpg)\n\n## A great toolbox for digital commerce applications\n\nThe Workflow primitive joins Medusa’s existing tools like API Routes for custom API request handlers, Admin Extensions to build dashboard UI extensions, EventBus and Subscribers for Pub/Sub, Services for custom business logic and connections to external systems, and, of course, Medusa’s commerce logic for core commerce functionality.\n\nMedusa comes packed with many great defaults that would take years for internal teams in digital commerce businesses to build and even more effort to continue to improve. With Workflows and Medusa 2.0, we will lower the bar for adopting Medusa into your stack. You can, for instance, start using Medusa’s Workflows to integrate your systems and, at your own pace, adopt the commerce modules that make sense for you.\n\nIt’s important to note that while the architectural changes we have planned will enable more complex use cases, Medusa will still be simple to set up. Our default API will have minimal breaking changes, and we are committed to making the upgrade path for existing Medusa projects smooth and painless.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nOver the next couple of months, we will ship many new standalone commerce modules. Each of them will be a key milestone toward shipping Medusa 2.0, and we are excited to hear your feedback and inputs as they are made available.\n\nYou can expect our Workflows to be released very soon. The Workflow tools can be used independently of Medusa 2.0, so you will not have to wait long before using this new, powerful primitive.

With our commerce primitives and tooling, developers can effortlessly build unique digital commerce applications at record speed.\n\n## **API Routes**\n\nAPI Routes in Medusa is a place for developers to add custom logic that HTTP requests can trigger. The endpoints have direct access to Medusa’s core services like the Product and Cart services and custom services added to your project or in installed plugins.\n\nTo create a custom endpoint in Medusa, developers have had to familiarize themselves with application routing and Express more generally. This created friction unrelated to our product, leading to frustration from users, the community, and our support team.\n\nToday, we are introducing API Routes - drastically simplifying creating custom endpoints in Medusa.\n\nDevelopers can now create custom routes using simple JavaScript without worrying about the intricacies of the Express Router. Routes are registered using the file system, an approach familiar to many from frameworks like Next.js and Svelte.\n\n```ts\n// api/admin/products/route.ts\nimport { MedusaRequest, MedusaResponse } from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\n\nexport async function GET(req: MedusaRequest, res: MedusaResponse) {\n\tconst productService = req.scope.resolve(\"productService\")\n\n\tconst products = await productService.list()\n\n\tres.json({ products })\n}\n```\n\nThe example above illustrates a few key points of API Routes:\n\n*   Endpoint paths are inferred from the file path\n\n*   `route.{ts|js}` is a special file that contains the router handlers\n\n*   HTTP methods are defined by the route handler name; here `GET`\n\nIn the example above, we register a `GET` route at path `/admin/products`.\n\n### **Dynamic Segments**\n\nAPI Routes support dynamic URL segments and are similarly registered through the file system.\n\n```ts\n// api/admin/products/[id]/route.ts\n\nimport { MedusaRequest, MedusaResponse } from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\n\nexport async function POST(req: MedusaRequest, res: MedusaResponse) {\n  const { id } = req.params\n\tconst { payload } = req.body\n\n\tconst productService = req.scope.resolve(\"productService\")\n\n\tconst product = await productService.update(id, payload)\n\n\tres.json({ product })\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, we register a `POST` route at path `/admin/products/:id`. The brackets in the file path, `api/admin/products/[id]/route.ts`, specify a parameter that can be accessed within the handler.\n\nYou can add as many dynamic segments as you’d like. However, if the parameter names clash, an error will be thrown, and your application will terminate.\n\n### **Middlewares**\n\nAdding middleware to routes has also been simplified. With API Routes, we are centralizing all middlewares in a file at `api/middlewares.{ts|js}`. In this file, you can register middleware to all endpoints, a subset of endpoints, or one at a time.\n\n```ts\n// api/middlewares.ts\n\nexport const config: MiddlewaresConfig = {\n  routes: [\n    {\n      method: [\"GET\", \"POST\"],\n      matcher: \"/store/*\",\n      middlewares: [someStoreMiddleware],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nPer default, middleware is registered globally. The `matcher` option is required to configure the paths the middlewares apply to. The `method` option is used to configure the specific methods the middlewares apply to.\n\nIn the example above, we register a middleware, `someStoreMiddleware`, to all paths starting with `/store` that use HTTP methods `GET` and `POST`.\n\n## **What’s next?**\n\nWe are excited to hear your thoughts about our new API Routes. If you have any feedback or experience issues, don’t hesitate to post on our GitHub Issues board or GitHub Discussions.\n\nIn the future, we plan to extend the `MedusaRequest` and `MedusaResponse` to offer an even better experience with access to types specific to our Request and Response context, such as the Awilix dependency container living at `req.scope`.\n\nTrack our progress on [X](https://twitter.com/medusajs) and in our [changelog](https://medusajs.com/changelog/).\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/visionary-b2b.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/visionary-b2b.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/visionary-b2b.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Visionary: Frictionless B2B ecommerce with Medusa","theme":"light","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/visionary-technologies (1).jpg","altText":"visionary-technologies","caption":""},"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","date":"2023-10-12","authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-osliwntg2.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-osliwntg2.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-osliwntg2.json"},"firstName":"Nicklas ","lastName":"Gellner","image":{"url":"/images/Nick.png","altText":"Nicklas Gellner"},"type":"Person"}],"excerpt":"Visionary Technologies used Medusa to build a new digital customer experience for their B2B customers, providing a frictionless customer journey with no intermediaries.","category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-h9m7ftmt6.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-h9m7ftmt6.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-h9m7ftmt6.json"},"name":"User stories","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"[Visionary Technologies](https://www.visionarytechnologies.co.nz/) has become a market leader in New Zealand for LED lighting technology, which it sells to business customers such as architects, electric trades, and similar.

The result has been a simplified customer journey with a shorter time-to-market while freeing up time for the sales team to acquire new customers instead of handling orders.![visionary-customer-journey](/images/Visionary-Customer-journey.jpg)\n\n## Advanced commerce needs\n\nAs with many B2B-focused webshops, Visionary had additional requirements to their commerce backend aside from handling traditional commerce tasks such as [products](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/products/overview), [carts and checkout](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/carts-and-checkout/overview), [orders](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/orders/overview) etc. Specifically, they required:\n\n*   **Unlimited Product variants:** The store should be able to support products with up to 300 variants, all with different prices, product pictures, etc.\n\n*   **Customer login and authentication:** The store should only be accessible for authenticated users of companies Visionary works with.\n\n*   **Multiple employees per customer:** Each B2B customer has multiple employees associated with them who all need to be able to purchase on the platform on behalf of their company.\n\n*   **Special pricing and discounts:** Visionary wanted a loyalty engine where customers earn discounts and special benefits based on their spending levels.\n\n*   **ERP synchronization:** Upon order completion, Medusa needs to synchronize orders with Visionary’s ERP system for order production and fulfillment.\n\nWhile exploring available options, Typed Development quickly realized that most SaaS ecommerce solutions did not offer the required flexibility for the job. Instead, they adopted Medusa’s commerce modules, giving them the right commerce logic to get started quickly and the flexibility to meet Visionary’s custom requirements.\n\n\u003cquote name=\"Jono Allen\" title=\"Founder of Typed Development\"\u003e\nWe spent 3 to 4 days tweaking Shopify to handle our product complexity with little luck. Afterwards, we went to Medusa and within 3 hours we had one of the most complex variants set up, and using the Next-starter we had a basic store going within half a day.\n\u003c/quote\u003e\n\n## Linking customers and companies\n\nVisionary wanted the employees of their B2B customers to be able to handle purchasing on their own in the online store. This would allow Visionary's sales representatives to devote less time to handle customers' manual orders and instead focus on acquiring new customers. Additionally, existing B2B customers would enjoy a more seamless purchasing experience, enabling their employees to complete orders online easily.\n\nTo allow employees of B2B customers to make direct purchases, Typed Development has added an employee layer to Medusa. This ensures employees are associated with their respective companies when logging into the store. Once logged in, they can browse products and make purchases on behalf of their company. After an order is placed, the order information is sent to a custom ERP system for production and fulfillment. In this setup:\n\n*   **Employees** own carts, which allows them to create orders.\n\n*   **Companies** own orders, which means they handle payments via invoices upon order completion.\n\nAside from the employee account, each company has admin accounts that, aside from creating orders, can add new employees and view all order and billing information.\n\n![b2b-purchasing-flow](/images/Visionary-Technologies-b2b-purchasing-flow.png)\n\n## Building a custom loyalty engine for Medusa\n\nVisionary wanted to reward loyal customers based on their online spending. To support this, Typed Development built a loyalty engine using [Medusa’s Pricing Strategies](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/price-lists/price-selection-strategy), which allows them to override and discount prices based on the customer group to which the customer belongs. This way, Typed Development could group customers into loyalty tiers based on spending, with each tier having certain product discounts associated with it.\n\nThe custom loyalty engine itself consists of two primary tiering mechanisms:\n\n*   **Upgrade tier:** This tier is determined by accumulating all customer spending to determine their loyalty tier. When a certain spending level is reached, the customer is upgraded to a new tier with better discounts.\n\n*   **Retainer tier:** This tier is determined by customer spending in the past 12 months. Customers must meet a minimum spending threshold during the period to stay in their current tier. This prevents customers with low or no spending from remaining in their tier. The spending for the retainer tier is reset when a customer reaches a new tier.\n\nThis loyalty engine has created a transparent discount system that is fully automated to control the different discount tiers of each customer.\n\n![loyalty-engine](/images/Visionary-Technologies-loyalty-engine.jpg)\n\n## Towards full automation\n\nBy the end of 2023, Visionary expects to handle over 1,000 monthly orders through Medusa. With its B2B ecommerce foundation already in place, the company is now focused on digitalizing and automating even more of its processes.\n\nOrder fulfillment using Visionary’s ERP is one process they look to optimize. Currently, it requires a lot of manual copy-pasting of order data from Medusa into the ERP. Instead, Typed Development hopes to use Medusa’s new [Admin Widgets](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/widgets) to extend the current order overview in Medusa, allowing Visionary to control delivery services and fulfillment for post-order creation directly within Medusa and afterward move that information into the ERP.\n\nTyped Development believes that the decision to go with an open and extendible solution like Medusa gives them the flexibility needed to easily build these custom automations that will benefit Visionary’s sales operations in the future.\n\n\u003cquote name=\"Jono Allen\" title=\"Founder of Typed Development\"\u003e\nWe feel that Medusa gives us a lot of capabilities to actually go in our own direction in terms of customizing and changing things, while allowing us to look through the code as well. It is easy to use and really gives us full control over the setup.\n\u003c/quote\u003e\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/new-authentication-methods.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/new-authentication-methods.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/new-authentication-methods.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"New and improved authentication methods","theme":"light","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/image (27).png","altText":"new-authentication-flow","caption":""},"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","date":"2023-09-29","authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json"},"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Juhl","role":"CTO \u0026 Co-founder","image":{"url":"/images/oli.jpeg","altText":"Oliver Juhl"},"type":"Person","bio":"CTO \u0026 Co-founder of Medusa\n"}],"excerpt":"In collaboration with our community, we have improved support for Admin authentication by introducing three separate approaches: Session, API Token, and Bearer Authentication.","category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json"},"name":"Product","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"We are excited to announce new and improved authentication methods in Medusa, built in collaboration with community contributor [David Preininger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-preininger-217956236/).\n\nThis update introduces a new authentication method and establishes a clear separation between the now three supported methods: Session, API Token, and Bearer Authentication. The separation will make it more obvious what to use for different cases. Whether your focus is server-side communication or SPAs, our authentication primitives will meet your needs.\n\n## **Authentication methods**\n\nFollowing this update, Medusa supports three authentication methods that each serve specific use cases better.\n\n### **Sessions**\n\nOur session authentication remains unchanged. This method is suitable for traditional server-side rendered web applications, such as webshops, because of its user-friendliness. Users sign in once, and the authenticated session is maintained throughout the rest of the user’s journey browsing the application.\n\n### **API token**\n\nOur API token authentication method has been slightly updated to follow best practices and comply with established conventions. More specifically, the header type has changed from Authorization with a `Bearer` prefix to a custom header tightly coupled with Medusa, `x-medusa-access-token`. The former is, not shockingly, reserved for bearer authentication. This method is suitable for server-to-server communication without direct user involvement.\n\nBelow is an example of using API key authentication:\n\n![api-key-authentication](/images/Untitled-bd22de40.png)\n\nThis is the only breaking change in version 1.17.0.\n\n### **Bearer token**\n\nBearer token authentication is a new method that utilizes JWT tokens, making it a suitable choice for Jamstack applications. Use this type of authentication when serving content from an API to different clients, such as SPAs or mobile applications. Additionally, this method will eliminate issues related to cookie constraints in browsers.\n\n## **The power of building in public**\n\nThis is yet another demonstration of the power of building open-source software. Our new and improved authentication methods were completed by David Preininger, who specializes in building customizable ecommerce solutions.\n\nThanks to David for his contribution. If you wish to contribute or have feature requests for Medusa, you are always welcome to contact our [core maintainers](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## **What’s next**\n\nThere are several possible follow-up improvements to the authentication system or applications that use it. We will likely update Medusa Admin to use JWT Bearer authentication as this is more suitable for the aforementioned reasons.\n\nFurthermore, David is working on incorporating these changes into the Medusa Authentication plugin built by core Medusa engineer Adrien. The plugin allows merchants to use additional authentication providers, including Google and Auth0.\n\nFinally, we are considering implementing two additional features to enhance the system's flexibility and capabilities further.\n\nFirstly, we aim to add native support for extending the authentication system with custom methods. This will allow for a more seamless integration of authentication methods specific to your business.\n\nSecondly, we plan to introduce API token management in Medusa Admin, eliminating the need for users to jump through hoops when wanting to use the API token authentication method.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/foraged-custom-marketplace.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/foraged-custom-marketplace.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/foraged-custom-marketplace.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Foraged: Building a custom marketplace experience with Medusa","theme":"light","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/user-story-foraged (2).jpg","altText":"foraged-marketplace","caption":""},"seo_keywords":"marketplace, medusa","date":"2023-09-27","authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-osliwntg2.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-osliwntg2.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-osliwntg2.json"},"firstName":"Nicklas ","lastName":"Gellner","image":{"url":"/images/Nick.png","altText":"Nicklas Gellner"},"type":"Person"}],"excerpt":"Foraged allows over 1,000 local sellers to market wild and specialty foods to home cooks and Michelin-starred restaurants through their Medusa-powered marketplace.","category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-h9m7ftmt6.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-h9m7ftmt6.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-h9m7ftmt6.json"},"name":"User stories","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"[Foraged](https://www.foraged.com/) is a two-sided marketplace for fresh wild and specialty foods like berries, mushrooms, truffles, and more. Foragers, farmers, and local stores list their products through the platform’s vendor portal, and everything from home cooks to Michelin-starred restaurants buy the products through the Foraged website or app. Using Medusa, the team has developed a custom experience where vendors can manage their entire shop from their dashboard, which is powered by Medusa. Meanwhile, customers can message, follow, and place special orders with their favorite sellers.\n\n\u003ccallout icon=\"lightBulbSolid\" button-label=\"Get started\" \nbutton-url=\"https://docs.medusajs.com/recipes/marketplace\"\u003e\n**Marketplace Recipe**\nSet up your own marketplace with Medusa. \u003c/callout\u003e\n\n## **Maximum flexibility to build a custom marketplace**\n\nAs producers and users of wild and specialty foods, Foraged founders Jack and Andy noticed the difficulties in selling and procuring these foods, which mostly happened locally or via small online communities. Driven by their passion for the area, they wanted to solve this problem via an online marketplace that would make wild and specialty foods more accessible to both professional and amateur chefs while giving small local businesses a new place to find customers.\n\n\u003cquote name=\"Jack Hamrick\" title=\"Co-founder and CEO at Foraged\"\u003e\nIf you take this very fragmented market and combine it with an incredibly passionate community and put that together on a platform marketplace, that’s a huge unlock.\n\u003c/quote\u003e\n\nTo build a first-of-its-kind wild and specialty food marketplace, they brought together a diverse team, including experienced engineers and a chef from Michelin-starred Noma, and later brought along prominent investors, including the[ VC firm Bessemer](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/12/foraged-mushroom-marketplace-seed/).\n\n![foraged-marketplace](/images/image%20\\(25\\).png)\n\nFor the proof of concept, Foraged attempted two approaches: customizing a WooCommerce shop and building their own custom platform. However, both approaches had shortcomings.\n\nWith the WooCommerce shop, vendors had performance issues during traffic peaks as the application quickly got bloated from handling too many integrations. With the custom-built solution, the engineering team encountered bugs and instabilities in their ecommerce platform at every release. This was problematic since Foraged wanted to do several weekly releases as a fast-scaling company. Additionally, it was challenging to develop all commerce-related functionality from the ground up.\n\nTo solve the challenges, the team decided to look for alternative options. Specifically, the team was looking to:\n\n*   **Support multiple vendors,** ensuring each vendor is able to handle products, shipping, orders, customers, and discount logic for their own store.\n\n*   **Extend** **admin functionality** beyond regular commerce logic, ensuring vendors can chat with customers, track store followers, and similar.\n\n*   **Integrate with multiple outside services** to add functionalities to the platform, like Shippo to handle vendor shipments, Auth0 for store access control, Contentful for product enrichment, etc.\n\nThe solution needed to be easily customizable and extensible to meet these requirements. Additionally, it had to provide a good developer experience when integrating with third-party solutions. The team found Medusa's modular architecture the perfect starting point for this.\n\n\u003cquote name=\"Andy Conner\" title=\"Co-founder and Head of Product at Foraged\"\u003e\nMedusa was a saving grace really. There was no other alternative that would give us the control and customization options needed to build the unique customer and vendor experiences we wanted.\n\u003c/quote\u003e\n\n## **Vendor dashboard to manage everything**\n\nWith many smaller shops and sellers on the platform, operating the store as frictionlessly as possible was a top priority for Foraged. Leveraging Medusa enabled them to focus on crafting a seamless vendor experience instead of building table-stakes commerce logic. Medusa’s modules would provide the necessary commerce features out-of-the-box while also offering the flexibility to add custom elements and integrate with 3rd party services.\n\n![](/images/foraged-overview.png)\n\nA key element in the seamless vendor experience was to ensure vendors could manage all store operations directly from their admin dashboard. To do this, Foraged enabled vendors to directly interact with 3rd party systems from the Medusa Admin, which is easily extensible through on-page [widgets](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/widgets) or [UI routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/routes) to create new pages. Some of their custom extensions include:\n\n*   **User authentication** for store admins to sign in to their store via a Gmail account or equivalent SSO option via [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).\n\n*   **Store dashboard** to view order notifications, find relevant articles, and access store data such as sales numbers, product views, and top-selling products.\n\n*   **Fulfillment management** enables merchants to create shipments, print shipping labels, and track deliveries directly in their Admin. A custom [Shippo](https://medusajs.com/plugins/medusa-fulfillment-shippo/) integration powers all this.\n\n*   **Extended product information** allows vendors to enrich product pages with additional data such as custom measurement specifications (Ozs., ltr., kg. etc.) and more product pictures using Medusa’s [Contentful integration](https://docs.medusajs.com/plugins/cms/contentful).\n\n*   **Message app for** customers to directly message vendors with order inquiries, product questions, and more powered by [SendBird](https://sendbird.com/). Vendors can manage all chats directly from their admin dashboard.\n\n*   **Waitlist feature** allows vendors to receive notifications when a customer signs up for a [product that is currently out of stock](https://medusajs.com/plugins/medusa-plugin-restock-notification/).\n\n*   **Follower lists** enable customers to follow and get notifications about their favorite stores’ products. Vendors can view all followers within their Admin Dashboard.\n\nMedusa’s out-of-the-box functionalities, such as [order overviews](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/orders/overview), [product management](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/products/overview), [discounts](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/discounts/overview), [gift cards](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/gift-cards/overview), etc., created an easy-to-manage dashboard for the Foraged vendors. Likewise, Medusa’s functionality was easily linked to the storefront, allowing the team to quickly and efficiently ship a great customer-facing webpage for the vendor's products.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/foraged-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/foraged.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\n## **Improved development speed**\n\nIn addition to providing the team with the flexibility to build a customized vendor and customer experience, Medusa enabled the team to move much faster than anticipated. Previously, they had a troubled release process with several instabilities, but now they can ship multiple times per week without issues. Furthermore, pre-built Medusa integrations for solutions such as [Contentful](https://docs.medusajs.com/plugins/cms/contentful), [Stripe](https://docs.medusajs.com/plugins/payment/stripe), [Algolia](https://docs.medusajs.com/plugins/search/algolia), and others helped the team quickly get up and running.\n\n\u003cquote name=\"Andy Conner\" title=\"Co-founder and Head of Product at Foraged\"\u003e\nWe now release to production several times a week as Medusa is just easy to work with. Shifting to Medusa has felt a bit like going from building a car from scratch to getting our own custom one where we just had to hook up the wires and put them together.\n\u003c/quote\u003e\n\nNext up, the team is looking to include subscription payments, allowing customers to subscribe to certain specialty foods for monthly deliveries. Aside from this, they are working on enabling vendors to create storefront customizations and utilizing Algolia to power dynamically populated shopping experiences, making it easier for customers to discover relevant products on the marketplace.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/announcing-multi-language-support.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/announcing-multi-language-support.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/announcing-multi-language-support.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Announcing Multi-language support in Medusa Admin","theme":"light","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/multi-language-support.jpg","altText":"multi-language-support","caption":""},"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","date":"2023-09-18","authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json"},"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Juhl","role":"CTO \u0026 Co-founder","image":{"url":"/images/oli.jpeg","altText":"Oliver Juhl"},"type":"Person","bio":"CTO \u0026 Co-founder of Medusa\n"}],"excerpt":"Following our latest community contribution, Medusa Admin can now be translated into your preferred language.","category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json"},"name":"Product","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"At Medusa, we’ve always focused heavily on empowering businesses to build products for a global audience with features like [multi-currency and multi-regional support](https://docs.medusajs.com/recipes/multi-region).\n\nToday, we are excited to bring the same level of internationalization to Medusa Admin with the introduction of multi-language support. Multi-language support allows merchants to operate Medusa Admin in their preferred language by choosing from already-supported locales or creating new translations themselves.\n\nThis version includes translations in English, French, and Portuguese.\n\n## Configuring your language\n\nTo configure your preferred locale, navigate to your store settings and select it from the list of supported languages:\n\n![](/images/translations-medusa.gif)\n\nThe configuration will be specific to you and stored in your browser. This means you don’t have to worry about messing up your co-workers’ experience when choosing the locale for your Medusa Admin. However, this also means you might occasionally need to re-configure it if the browser storage is cleared.\n\n## Adding new translations\n\nIf your preferred language is not currently supported, we encourage you to create and contribute with new translations to our project. This way, our community and users all over the world can benefit from them, and you will take part in helping us become the globally preferred commerce solution.\n\nThe process of adding a new translation file is relatively straightforward. You need to clone our [project](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa), copy one of the existing translation files, rename the file to the locale you are adding, and fill in all the translations.\n\nFor a detailed step-by-step guide, refer to our documentation covering [creating new admin translations](https://docs.medusajs.com/contribution/admin-translations).\n\n## What’s next?\n\nMulti-language support in Medusa Admin is the first step toward a fully internationalized merchant experience.\n\nIn the future, we will ship multi-language support to [Widgets](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/widgets) and [UI Routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/routes), so your Admin Extensions are displayed according to the locale setting of your store.\n\nAdditionally, we plan to support translation overrides, enabling you to replace existing translations with your own from your Medusa project. This feature will be useful in creating a bespoke merchant experience and will ensure that you can use admin extensions even if they are yet to be translated by the plugin author.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nMulti-language support was built entirely by community contributors [Geoffroy Empain](https://github.com/gempain) and [Mohammad Javad](https://github.com/mj-mehdizadeh).

The company operates over 155 outlets in 5 countries.  CP Axtra chose Medusa for their online platform, [Makro PRO](https://www.makro.pro/), which processes hundreds of individual and business orders from stores across Thailand every hour.\n\nWith Medusa’s building blocks, the Makro team simplified complexity and automated order management for Makro PRO, and they are now expanding the use of Medusa as their omnichannel order orchestration solution across all digital sales.\n\n## Complexity at scale\n\n![Makro PRO overview](/images/Makro%20Pro%20overview%20(2)-a93e503e.svg)\n\nMakro PRO offers thousands of products across various categories such as food, home appliances, and electronics. Customers can access the store through [Makro PRO](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/makro-pro/id1570380497) mobile app and website. Orders are dispatched from over 100 stores across Thailand every hour. This expedited service requires efficient routing of fulfillments to nearby stores and third-party distributors.\n\nIn addition to the complex fulfillment handling, Makro PRO needed a commerce backend that would support:\n\n*   **High order volume:** The solution needs to handle more than 5,000 orders daily, some of them including hundreds of line items, without compromising performance.\n*   **Custom-built stack:** The solution must seamlessly integrate with their custom-built services, enabling them to retain control over essential elements like checkout, payment, and product services.\n*   **Scalable**: The solution needs to handle orders from a product assortment curated across hundreds of Makro shops in Thailand along with its 3rd party distributor network.\n\n## From monolith to modular\n\nMakro PRO initially used a leading proprietary solution as their commerce backend but found their APIs increasingly difficult to integrate with as they rolled out [makro.pro](http://makro.pro/) across more stores in their network. For example, Makro reached rate limits and had to compromise on features due to the rigidity of its API.\n\nThe limitations led the team to search for a more adaptable solution. Building from scratch would be too time-consuming, so the team looked for a solution that would be great to work with for the team’s internal users but also be flexible enough to build great end-customer experiences around. The team evaluated various SaaS and open-source alternatives but ultimately chose to embrace Medusa, which would allow them to maintain data and stack ownership while providing core commerce primitives to build great customer experiences around.\n\n\u003cquote name=\"Pradeep Kumar\" title=\"Tech Lead on the project\"\u003e\nMedusa offered the flexibility we needed to build a scalable setup. We could use our own custom checkout, fulfillment, and payment services while leveraging Medusa’s event-driven architecture for interprocess communication.\n\u003c/quote\u003e\n\n## Medusa for Omnichannel Order Orchestration\n\n![Omnichannel commerce setup](/images/Makro%20Pro%20setup%20(2\\).svg)\nMedusa is utilized as a central hub for order orchestration. Once orders pass through from one of Makro's storefronts, they are registered within Medusa and broken down by fulfillment type:\n\n*   **1st party fulfillment** (1P) orders are sent to a custom-built system that coordinates the fulfillment across Makro stores.\n*   **3rd party fulfillment** (3P) orders are sent to [Mirakl](https://www.mirakl.com/), a platform coordinating Makro's network of third-party sellers.\n\nThe Makro team utilized Medusa's customizable and event-driven architecture to manage the complexity of multiple fulfillment types per order. The team created a plugin using webhooks that allows Medusa to update the order statuses (in process, fulfilled, returned etc.) based on events triggered within the 1P and 3P systems. This enables Medusa to act as a unified order overview, which customer support uses as a reference point to check order statuses in real-time.\n\nSimilar custom integrations were also implemented for refund orchestration via their custom payment service.\n\n\u003cquote name=\"Thanakrit Gwan Juthamongkhon\" title=\"Module lead on the project\"\u003e\nThe design of the core modules [in Medusa] is consistent, it is clear how to use the database structures, and the domain modelling is done beautifully.

The React component library for Medusa UI was introduced together with the [general availability of Admin Extensions](https://medusajs.com/blog/medusa-ui-and-general-availability-of-admin-extensions/) to make it simple to build beautiful extensions. Now, plugin authors (and anyone else curious) can build their designs in Figma using the same system our design team uses. Below, we share some of the core principles of the Medusa UI design system and its significance.\n\n## Focus on function\n\nThe fundamental principle driving Medusa UI is simplicity, functionality, and low maintenance. We've streamlined the system to be lightweight yet effective, emphasizing the essentials without unnecessary complexities. Our approach is to include just the right amount of tokens and components so the designer using the system feels empowered and not overwhelmed.\n\nMedusa UI embodies this principle through its straightforward approach. It is based on just two core elements: Tokens and Components. Tokens are named after their functionality and not their value. At first glimpse, this seems like a lot, but once you start using the system, you feel the speed. For instance, when designing, one can easily access default background colors by typing \"bg-base\" or default text colors with \"fg-base”\n\n![](/images/default-fg-colors.jpg)\n\nAll with variations referring to their function like Hover, Pressed, etc. You don’t need to remember what shade of Grey you decided to go with when you cursor over Secondary Buttons. Similarly, typography is organized into groups like Headers, Text, and Code. For some components, we use the very popular principles of Atomic Design Systems, but only if/when it makes sense. Some components are just components if it is faster to use and build it that way. We don’t rely on some heavy guidelines other than keep asking ourselves when we add new stuff: Does this speed up the design and development process?\n\n## What's next?\n\nIf you want to dive deeper, we encourage you to explore Admin Extensions as a place to experiment with Medusa UI to integrate with the Admin Dashboard seamlessly. Furthermore, we are eager to get suggestions from the community on improvements to the system or requests for additional components to include. Reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/medusajs) or [Github](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) to share your thoughts.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/medusa-ui-and-general-availability-of-admin-extensions.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/medusa-ui-and-general-availability-of-admin-extensions.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/medusa-ui-and-general-availability-of-admin-extensions.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Medusa UI and general availability of Admin Extensions","theme":"light","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/admin-extensibility-7807793e.jpg","altText":"Medusa UI and general availability of Admin Extensions","caption":""},"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","date":"2023-08-17","authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-5u6je47u2.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-5u6je47u2.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-5u6je47u2.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Kasper","image":{"url":"/images/Kasper.webp","altText":"Person photo"},"lastName":"Kristensen","role":"SW Engineer"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-zxw3bm4z1.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-zxw3bm4z1.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-zxw3bm4z1.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Ludvig","lastName":"Rask","username":"lorem-ipsum","email":"lorem-ipsum","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/T01U0QK5QTA-U02NPNSFQ4X-c1748f1d6c38-512.jpeg","altText":"Ludvig Rask"}},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-27guyqiyb.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-27guyqiyb.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-27guyqiyb.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Rares","lastName":"Capilnar","username":"lorem-ipsum","email":"lorem-ipsum","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/T01U0QK5QTA-U04H8Q44HEF-1c3e9116190f-512.jpeg","altText":"Rares Capilnar"}}],"excerpt":"Today we are excited to announce the general availability of Admin Extensibility.","category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json"},"name":"Product","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"During [Recap](https://medusajs.com/recap/) in June, we announced the [beta launch of Admin Extensibility](https://medusajs.com/blog/announcing-admin-extensions/) — a way for developers and plugin authors to create components that enrich the merchant experience through additional context and tailored workflows.\n\nToday we are excited to announce the general availability of Admin Extensibility. To try it out, upgrade to the latest version of Medusa and check out our guide to building your first Admin Extensions. \n\n```bash\nyarn add @medusajs/admin@latest @medusajs/medusa@latest\n```\n\nOur community has helped us improve our Admin Extensibility feature and provided input to enhance the developer experience further. One area we especially wanted to tackle was making it easy to create Admin Extensions with the same look and feel as the rest of the Admin Dashboard.  As a result, we are excited to introduce Medusa UI – a component library for building beautiful and performant Admin Extensions fast. With minimal effort, the library enables developers to achieve the same look and feel as the rest of Medusa Admin when building UI Routes and Widgets.\n\n## Medusa UI\n\nMedusa UI is a React implementation of the Medusa design system. Most components are based on [Radix UI Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives), and we use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, shipping our own preset with our customizations.\n\nWe aimed to keep the component APIs light, composable, and reasonably unopinionated. Much like the primitives we have built upon, we have tried to leverage and respect the native HTML API as much as possible, and we hope you will find the components easy to get started with and put together to build the experiences you need.\n\nUsing Medusa UI in an Admin Extension can be as simple as:\n\n```tsx\nimport type { WidgetConfig } from \"@medusajs/admin\"\nimport { Button, Container, Heading } from \"@medusajs/ui\"\n\nexport default ({ order }) =\u003e {\n\n  const sendOrderToErp = () =\u003e {\n    // POST order details to your ERP\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cContainer\u003e\n      \u003cHeading\u003eYour ERP\u003c/Heading\u003e\n      \u003cButton onClick={() =\u003e sendOrderToErp()}\u003ePush order\u003c/Button\u003e\n    \u003c/Container\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport const config: WidgetConfig = {\n\tzone: \"order.details.after\",\n} \n```\n\nTo help you get started with Medusa UI, we have published [its own Documentation site](https://docs.medusajs.com/ui). This should get you up and running and provide more information on the available components and how to use them. You will also find information on Medusa Icons we have made public and more details on theming.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we aim to provide more composition and complex Medusa-specific examples within the docs.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nTo get started building Admin Extensions, visit the guide in [Our Documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/widgets). We are excited to see how this new feature will be leveraged to build powerful digital commerce applications."},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/community-highlights-2.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/community-highlights-2.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/community-highlights-2.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Community Highlights: Svelte Storefront, Medusa Flutter Admin, and lots of new plugins","theme":"light","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/community-highlight.jpg","altText":"Medusa Community Highlights 2","caption":"Medusa Community Highlights 2"},"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","date":"2023-08-09","authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-osliwntg2.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-osliwntg2.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-osliwntg2.json"},"firstName":"Nicklas ","lastName":"Gellner","image":{"url":"/images/Nick.png","altText":"Nicklas Gellner"},"type":"Person"}],"excerpt":"SvelteKit Storefront starter, Medusa Admin built with Flutter, along with plugins for Postmark, blog posts management, Canada Post, and more.

We are always excited about these contributions, which range from plugins to platforms and templates. Currently, our [Plugin Library](https://medusajs.com/plugins/) has more than 100 open-source plugins available via npm. Below, we wanted to highlight some of the latest additions from our community members.\n\n## Latest community contributions\n\n### SvelteKit Storefront Starter for Medusa\n\n![SvelteKit-Medusa](/images/Untitled%20(14\\)-87873634.png)\n\nIn our most recent [community highlight](https://medusajs.com/blog/community-highlights-1/), we were excited to announce the introduction of the SvelteKit client. Now, [Lacey Pevey](https://github.com/pevey) made it even easier to get started using [Svelte](https://kit.svelte.dev/) with her new [SvelteKit eCommerce Store Starter](https://github.com/pevey/sveltekit-medusa-starter/tree/main), a Svelte storefront designed to integrate with your Medusa backend seamlessly.\n\nThe starter uses the [SvelteKit client](https://medusajs.com/plugins/sveltekit-medusa-client/) behind the scenes to interact with the Medusa backend. It comes with ready-to-use pages like a product gallery and product detail pages. You will also find auth, cart, and checkout flows implemented in the starter. All the pages and flows are customizable to adapt the template to your use case.\n\nYou can watch Lacey set up Medusa with Svelte in her latest video from the Svelte Society, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVVHxows9dY).\n\n### Postmark Plugin\n\n[Bram Hammer](https://github.com/breakerh) recently contributed with a new [Postmark plugin](https://medusajs.com/plugins/medusa-plugin-postmark/). The plugin lets you use the Postmark service as a [notification provider](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/notification/overview) with your Medusa backend. This can be useful for upselling and transactional emails, among other things.\n\nBram even took this plugin a step further by adding support for generating and attaching PDF invoices and credit notes to customer emails. Additionally, it lets you send personalized reminder emails to customers who have abandoned their cart or upselling emails to customers who have recently purchased from specific collections.\n\n### Medusa Blog Plugin\n\n[Lacey Pevey](https://github.com/pevey) developed a [blog plugin](https://medusajs.com/plugins/medusa-plugin-blog/) for users managing blog pages as part of their commerce site. This plugin expands the capabilities of your Medusa backend by enabling you to organize and manage blogging content.\n\nWith this plugin, you can create your own blog posts and conveniently categorize them using tags such as product, collection, or custom values already existing within your store. Additionally, it enables you to query and retrieve all your blog posts based on various criteria, including tags, categories, products, or collections, for a more user-friendly blog experience.\n\n### Medusa Admin Flutter in beta\n\n![Medusa-Admin-Flutter](/images/Medusa-Admin-Mobile-Screenshot-48f33110.png)\n\n[Ragheb](https://github.com/mllrr96) is developing a mobile-optimized Medusa Admin app using Flutter for iOS and Android. The app is currently in beta, but you can test it and keep track of newly added features and enhancements by visiting its [git repository](https://github.com/mllrr96/Medusa-Admin-Flutter).\n\nDespite being in beta, the app already offers a range of valuable features, such as updating store settings (regions, sales channels, etc.) and managing collections of products, customers, and discounts. The app also includes a built-in dark mode feature.\n\n### Canada Post Fulfillment plugin\n\n[Alexghebo](https://github.com/alexghebo) created a [Canada Post plugin](https://medusajs.com/plugins/medusa-fulfillment-canadapost/) for integrating your Medusa backend with the Canada Post fulfillment provider, which can be utilized during the checkout process and throughout the order management workflow.\n\nThe plugin enables customers to access real-time shipping rates and track their orders. It also allows merchants to manage shipping labels, generate customs documentation, and monitor shipment statuses, ultimately enhancing the overall shopping experience for buyers and sellers.\n\n### Platform.sh for Medusa deployment\n\n[Vinnie Russo](https://github.com/vincenzo) built a [Platform.sh template](https://github.com/platformista/medusa) designed to ease the deployment process for a Medusa ecommerce solution. The template includes the essential Medusa backend infrastructure, the admin dashboard, and the Next.js storefront.\n\nThe template allows users to use [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh/)’s infrastructure to launch their Medusa ecommerce shop with a single click. [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh/) is a PaaS that offers a unified solution for building, running, and scaling websites and applications.\n\n## Community Radar\n\n\u003ctweet tweetId=\"1679568690138980352\" /\u003e\n\nShout-out from the Vercel-team to our updated Medusa Next.js Starter Template with App Router support.\n\n\u003ctweet tweetId=\"1687131317845037059\" /\u003e\n\n[Lacey Pevey](https://github.com/pevey) shows how to combine Svelte and Medusa on the latest live stream from the Svelte Society.\n\n\u003ctweet tweetId=\"1685718106583293952\" /\u003e\n\nAdil showing off some well-deserved Medusa merch from his community contributions.\n\n## Created something cool with Medusa?

For example, you can add a button on the order details page that links to the order in an integrated ERP system.\n\n\nWidgets are easy to build, and Medusa automatically registers them when exporting a React component and its configuration from files placed in the `src/admin/widgets` directory in your project or plugins.\n\n\nFor example, you can add a link to an ERP system in your order details page with the following widget:\n\n\n```typescript\n// my-plugin/src/admin/widgets/erp-button.tsx\n\nimport type { WidgetConfig } from \"@medusajs/admin\"\n\nexport default ({ order }) =\u003e {\n  const link = `https://myerp.com/orders/${order.id}`\n  return (\n    \u003ca href={link}\u003e\n\t    View in MyERP\n\t\u003c/a\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport const config: WidgetConfig = {\n  zone: \"order.details.after\"\n}\n```\n\n\nWidgets can be placed on most existing pages in the Admin Dashboard, and often there are multiple zones within each page.\n\n\nYou can learn more about widgets in [our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/widgets).\n\n\n## Admin UI Routes\n\n\nAnother aspect of admin extensions that we’re introducing is Admin UI Routes. You’ll be able to add new routes into your admin dashboard in routes similar to Next.js 13 routes.\n\n\nSimilar to Widgets, Admin UI Routes are simply exported React components created in files under the `src/admin/routes` directory. You can also specify that these routes can be added into the sidebar.\n\n\nFor example, you can add a new “Custom Route” link into the sidebar by creating the following component:\n\n\n```typescript\n// src/admin/routes/custom/page.tsx\n\nimport { RouteConfig } from \"@medusajs/admin\"\nimport { CustomIcon } from \"../../icons/custom\"\n\nconst CustomPage = () =\u003e {\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      This is my custom route\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport const config: RouteConfig = {\n  link: {\n    label: \"Custom Route\",\n    icon: CustomIcon,\n  },\n}\n\nexport default CustomPage\n```\n\n\nYou can learn more about Admin UI Routes in [our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/routes).\n\n\n## Enhanced Developer Experience\n\n\nAn important constraint for our work when building Admin Extensibility was ensuring a great development workflow.\n\n\nAs mentioned, we are therefore introducing the `src/admin/widgets` and `src/admin/routes` directories as new special directories in Medusa plugins and projects. The Medusa core automatically scans for valid Widgets and Admin UI Routes during build time, ensuring that you don’t have to battle with configuration files and can get straight to solving the important problems you are working on.\n\n\nAdditionally, we extended the `medusa develop` command used to start your development server. We now listen for changes in the `src/admin` folder and hot reload your dashboard, so you can instantly view your changes as you build new Widgets and Admin UI Routes.\n\n\n## Shipping admin extensions in plugins\n\n\nWidgets and UI Routes can ship together with plugins, adding a new dimension to their capabilities. For example, we have added a Widget to the Stripe plugin that shows additional data like fraud evaluation on your order details page when the plugin is installed.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/custom-widget-fraud-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/media/custom-widget-fraud.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\n\nTo ship Admin extensions with plugins, plugin developers need to run the bundle command from `@medusajs/admin` and Medusa will then automatically pick up the customization upon installation:\n\n\n```bash\nmedusa-admin bundle\n```\n\n\nWhen installing plugins you can specify in your `medusa-config.js` file whether you want a plugin’s Admin extensions injected in your dashboard or not to ensure you are always in control of the merchant experience. Opting in to admin extensions is done with the `enableUI` option:\n\n\n```javascript\n// medusa-config.js\n\nmodule.export = {\n  ...,\n  plugins: [\n    {\n       resolve: \"medusa-payment-stripe\",\n       options: {\n         ...,\n         enableUI: true,\n       }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\nYou can learn more about creating plugins including admin extensions in [our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/plugins/create).\n\n\n## What’s Next?\n\n\nAdmin extensions are still in beta, so we will continue on improving this feature to make it stable and provide a better developer experience.\n\n\nWe are also excited to see what you will build with the new Admin Extensibility feature and as we continue improving the feature, we would love to hear your feedback.\n\n\nIf you want to learn more about Admin Extensibility, check out the docs [here](https://medusa-docs-git-docs-recap-2023-q2-medusajs.vercel.app/admin/widgets).\n\n\nYou can also visit our [Discord](https://discord.gg/medusajs) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/discussions) to provide feedback on the feature.\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/announcing-product-module.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/announcing-product-module.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/announcing-product-module.md"},"title":"Announcing Product Module","date":"2023-06-20","excerpt":"Today, we are thrilled to bring our commerce building blocks closer to frontend frameworks and serverless environments with the beta release of our Product Module.","type":"PostLayout","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/serverless-product-module.jpg","altText":"altText of the image","caption":"Caption of the image","objectFit":"cover","elementId":"","height":0,"width":0},"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-m2422br48.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-m2422br48.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-m2422br48.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Riqwan","lastName":"Thamir","username":"lorem-ipsum","email":"lorem-ipsum","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/5105988.png","altText":"Riqwan Thamir"}},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-yz371kn2y.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-yz371kn2y.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-yz371kn2y.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Rodrigues","username":"lorem-ipsum","email":"lorem-ipsum","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/37986729.jpeg","altText":"Carlos Rodrigues"}},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-5p9uxe17y.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-5p9uxe17y.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-5p9uxe17y.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Adrien","lastName":"de Peretti","username":"lorem-ipsum","email":"lorem-ipsum","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/25098370.jpeg","altText":"Adrien de Peretti"}},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-9uaduciht.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-9uaduciht.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-9uaduciht.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Frane","lastName":"Polić","username":"lorem-ipsum","email":"lorem-ipsum","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/16856471.jpeg","altText":"Frane Polić"}}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json"},"name":"Product","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"Building rich commerce experiences often starts in the front end. But the backend is what defines the boundaries of what’s possible. This realization is what motivated Medusa and our approach to simplifying commerce development.\n\nWhile Medusa has made building deep customization in your backend easy, creating these customizations requires developers to switch contexts between storefront and backend codebases.\n\nToday, we are thrilled to bring our commerce building blocks closer to frontend frameworks and serverless environments with the beta release of our Product Module.\n\nThe Product Module enables developers to access Products, Variants, Categories, and more through a standalone package that can be installed and run in Next.js functions and other Node.js compatible runtimes.\n\n## Usage Example with Next.js\n\nHere is what the Product Module looks like used in a Next.js function:\n\n```\n// app/api/products/route.ts\n\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport { initialize } from \"@medusajs/product\"\n\nexport async function GET(request: Request) {\n  const productService = await initialize()\n\n  const products = await productService.list({\n\t\ttags: { value: [\"featured\"] },\n\t}, {\n    take: 5\n  })\n\n  return NextResponse.json({ products })\n} \n```\n\nWith the `initialize` call, the Product Module establishes a connection to your database and gives you a Product Service to run queries through.\n\nWhen installed, the Product Module feels like an extension of your codebase that you can use to build bespoke experiences across your storefront with minimal friction and full control.\n\nLearn more about how to use the Product module in [our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/products/serverless-module).\n\n## Serverless Compatibility\n\nThe Product Module works independently of your Medusa backend and can be deployed directly to serverless environments like Vercel. This new deployment mode has many benefits, like providing auto-scaling during traffic spikes without configuring advanced infrastructure.\n\n## Product Module Demo\n\nTo demonstrate how the Product Module works with Vercel and Next.js, we have built an ecommerce personalization demo. The demo uses the visitor’s location and a user’s session to personalize what products are shown to the customer first.\n\nThe personalization code runs directly in a Next.js function deployed to Vercel and uses Medusa’s Product Module to query and respond with relevant products.\n\nYou can check out the demo [here](http://product-module.medusajs.com) and learn more about how it works.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/product-module-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/product-module.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\n## Runs in any Node.js project\n\nThe Product Module can be used in any Node.js project, including other frontend frameworks like Nuxt, SvelteKit, and Remix, but also in more traditional Node applications.\n\nThis makes Medusa portable to existing projects that need to orchestrate and manage products. As more of Medusa’s features adopt this new approach, this opens an incremental migration path for larger applications.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nWith the initial release of the Product Module, the scope has been constrained to read-only operations, but this is still powerful enough for you to play around with and understand our direction.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we will be working on adding write operations to the Product Module, making it possible to create and update Products, Variants, and more through the module.\n\nLater this year, we will ship more modules that adopt this new approach and pushes boundaries for what’s possible in digital commerce.\n\nIf you have feedback or ideas for improvements, please join the conversation in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/medusajs) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/discussions).\n\nCheck out more product announcements on our [Recap page](https://medusajs.com/recap).

From the beginning, Medusa was built to support omnichannel sales and with the introduction of the[ Inventory module](https://medusajs.com/blog/announcing-multi-warehouse/) in April, we further strengthened these capabilities with multi-warehouse support.\n\nToday, we are excited to announce Reservations Management, which gives merchants a better overview and control of their inventory status.\n\n## A real-time overview of your inventory\n\nReservations in Medusa are virtual reductions in stock to avoid overselling, and they are automatically created after customers place orders pending fulfillment.\n\nWith Reservation Management, we are bringing a new view to the Admin Dashboard, where merchants can see Reservations across Stock Locations.\n\n![](/images/sc0zYs4tJO.png)\n\nReservations can be accessed from your inventory list to quickly answer questions like “What orders hold reservations on this item?”.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/reservation-management-real-time-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/reservation-management-real-time.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\n## Custom reservations for new experiences\n\nWith better visibility of Reservations in the Admin Dashboard, we also enable new uses for Reservations. Merchants can now create and edit Reservations directly from Admin, and add descriptions and metadata to provide context to a Reservation’s origin.\n\nFor example, if a merchant wants to ensure stock for certain customers (e.g., physical retail customers), they can create a Reservation and specify in the description field which customers the stock is reserved for.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/reservation-management-custom-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/reservation-management-custom.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\nWe have built a demo to show how Reservations can be used as a building block in omnichannel experiences. In the demo, we walk through how to create a book-online-try-in-store feature for an e-commerce website. Customers select a size they want to try in a physical retail store, and a Reservation ensures that the item is ready for them to try when they arrive.\n\n[The demo](https://reservation-demo.vercel.app/) uses our Inventory Module to create Reservations directly in a Next.js function.\n\n## Filters to find what you need\n\nTogether with the new capabilities, we have added advanced filtering to ensure tracking down relevant Reservations is quick and easy. You can filter based on items, descriptions, creation dates, and more.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/reservation-management-filters-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/reservation-management-filters.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\n## APIs and integrations\n\nReservation management has powerful APIs to enable automated orchestration and integration with ERP and IMS systems. You can learn more about the Inventory Module and its APIs in [our docs](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/multiwarehouse/overview).\n\n## What’s next?\n\nMedusa makes it easy for developers to create rich digital commerce applications. With the new Reservation Management features, we are taking another step toward simplifying the complexities of omnichannel commerce, which Medusa is already being used for today.\n\nAs we build new and more advanced features to support developers in building the next generation of commerce, it’s important to ensure that the underlying data is accessible and manageable by users.\n\nWe are excited to see what creative ways you will put Reservations to use and, as always, would love to hear your feedback and input on how we can improve Medusa’s omnichannel capabilities further.

With Medusa, it was surprisingly simple to build delightful customer experiences like this.\n\u003c/quote\u003e\n\nAgilo used Medusa’s modular building blocks to create Tekla’s new POS application.\n\nUsing Medusa’s Sales Channel and Multi-warehouse modules, Agilo was able to quickly create a seamless omnichannel experience across both in-store and online purchases.\n\n## Expanding to Omnichannel Experiences\n\nA big challenge when opening a store is the added complexity of logistics and operations. With the new store, Tekla had to track inventory in their existing distribution center and the new store’s stockroom while ensuring that the store’s stock would not be used to fulfill global orders placed online.\n\nThese complexities were easily solved with Medusa's [Sales Channels](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/sales-channels) and [Multi-warehouse](https://medusajs.com/blog/announcing-multi-warehouse/) modules which give Tekla control of associations between stock locations and sales channels.\n\n\u003cquote name=\"Josip Matić\" title=\"Agilo’s lead developer on the project\"\u003e\nWe were surprised with how easy it was to set up all the necessary features for the POS app and the omnichannel experience. From the sales channels to the multi-warehouse features, all of it was easy to integrate with Tekla’s existing backend.\n\u003c/quote\u003e\n\nThe Agilo team was simply able to open a new sales channel for the Copenhagen Store and associate the store’s stock location with it. Tekla also chose to make its distribution center stock available to the store to enable endless aisle functionalities.\n\n![](/images/tekla-article-diagram-minimal.jpg)\n\nWith Medusa’s multi-warehouse modules, Tekla can also get a real-time overview of inventory movements, levels, and stock reservations across locations. Having this information at the fingertips of store staff ensures that they can always give the best service to visiting customers.\n\n## A **Scalable foundation**\n\nTekla's commerce stack composes several systems, each chosen for its ability to meet Tekla's needs best. Medusa's developer tools simplify the complexity of operating a composable stack like this. For example, [Medusa React](https://docs.medusajs.com/medusa-react/overview) helped integrate the POS app into Tekla's setup by allowing Agilo to reuse code from the storefront in the React Native app.\n\n\u003cquote name=\"Josip Matić\" title=\"Agilo’s lead developer on the project\"\u003e\nBeing able to use familiar technologies and Medusa’s intuitive API was a great win for speed and developer experience.

Webbers chose Medusa for its building blocks, which provided them with the flexibility to support Good Chef’s subscription logic while giving customers a great online experience.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover;\" poster=\"/images/goodchef-video-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/goodchef-video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\n## Ideal solution for a bespoke subscription model\n\nWhen scoping the Good Chef project, Webbers identified that the subscription logic would be a key constraint on the implementation. Other ecommerce platforms were too rigid to support Good Chef's subscriptions, and the alternative of building the entire system from scratch would mean spending a lot of time recreating core commerce features like cart logic and discounts.\n\nInstead, they chose to use Medusa, which provides building blocks for core commerce logic that can easily be customized for custom needs, like Good Chef's subscriptions.\n\n\u003cquote name=\"Daan van den Burg\" title=\"Managing Partner at Webbers Agency\"\u003e\nWe had used Magento and WooCommerce in the past, but they were not ideal for a modern headless stack. We tested Shopify, but then quickly hit a limit on how scalable and customizable the setup could be.\n\u003c/quote\u003e\n\nIt was important for Good Chef that subscriptions could be paid with the customer's preferred payment method. Likewise, they wanted the subscription flow, e.g. when renewals should happen, to be controllable as part of the commerce logic. This meant that Webbers couldn't use a payment provider-specific subscription solution like Stripe Billing.\n\nSo, they decided to build the subscription logic into Good Chef's Medusa project, making it independent of payment providers and giving customers the best experience.\n\n## Building Subscription into Medusa\n\nIt is possible for customers to make single purchases on the site, but for the most part, customers sign up via the subscription flow outlined below.\n\n![](/images/goodchef-customer-journey-2_(3\\).png)\n\nTo implement subscriptions, Webbers leveraged Medusa's support for [custom data models](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/entities/overview). Webbers created a Subscription data model to hold information about Good Chef's offerings, including type of meal box, available frequencies and prices. Additionally, they added relations between Orders and Subscriptions to be able to track which Subscription an Order is related to.\n\n\u003cquote name=\"Pepijn van Vlaanderen\" title=\"Head of Development at Webbers\"\u003e\nThe architecture of Medusa made it simple to add custom logic to the codebase. It was very easy to create our own entities and extend Orders in Medusa.\n\u003c/quote\u003e\n\nTo trigger the creation of new Orders, Webbers used [Medusa's cron jobs](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/scheduled-jobs/overview) to execute a nightly check for Subscriptions that need renewal. Orders are created with Line Items of the customer's chosen meal box and are automatically paid for through the Subscription payment method.\n\n![](/images/goodchef_payment_flow_-_vertical_(2\\).jpg)\n\nWith this implementation, Webbers was able to bring Good Chef’s vision to life without compromising the commerce system’s flexibility or their control over the logic behind the subscription flow.\n\n## Straightforward Developer Experience\n\nThis project was Webbers’ first time using Medusa, so they had to learn its architecture and fundamentals to understand how to customize it and implement Good Chef’s use case. This was not a big challenge, and they quickly grasped the concepts within Medusa and how to utilize them.\n\n\u003cquote name=\"Pepijn van Vlaanderen\" title=\"Head of Development at Webbers\"\u003e\nIt was a new system for us, but it was straightforward and easy to learn.\n\u003c/quote\u003e\n\nOne of the aspects the Webbers team has come to appreciate is the developer experience that Medusa provides. It offers the flexibility to select only the necessary functionality for their use case and extend with custom logic when needed.\n\nThis made Medusa the commerce infrastructure of choice for Webbers, as they now use it as their go-to solution in other client projects.\n\n\u003cquote name=\"Pepijn van Vlaanderen\" title=\"Head of Development at Webbers\"\u003e\nWe like the SDK approach that Medusa offers, as it makes it easy for us to cherry-pick what we need and quickly build it out. It gave us the confidence to use Medusa for other projects so that we can help our clients and give them a stable ecommerce infrastructure.\n\u003c/quote\u003e"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/community-highlights-1.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/community-highlights-1.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/community-highlights-1.md"},"title":"Community Highlights: Strapi Integration, SES Plugin, and More!","date":"2023-05-15","excerpt":"Check out the latest contributions from the community!","type":"PostLayout","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/community-highlights-1-bc5f54b5.jpg","altText":"Community Highlights: Strapi Integration, SES Plugin, and More!","caption":"Caption of the image","objectFit":"cover","elementId":"","height":0,"width":0},"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-eb2no2kx3.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-eb2no2kx3.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-eb2no2kx3.json"},"firstName":"Shahed ","lastName":"Nasser","role":"Role","image":{"url":"/images/27354907.jpeg","altText":"Person photo"},"type":"Person"}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-29bs7fo47.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json"},"type":"Category","name":"Community"},"markdown_content":"[Changing the way commerce is built](https://medusajs.com/readme/) is no easy undertaking.

Within this monorepository, you’ll find a Strapi project, a Medusa plugin for Strapi, a Strapi plugin for Medusa, and other components that will make your integration between Medusa and Strapi successful.\n\nBy integrating Strapi and Medusa, you can utilize rich CMS features that Strapi provides while using Medusa’s powerful commerce features.\n\nCheck out the [monorepository](https://github.com/SGFGOV/medusa-strapi-repo) for more details about the project and how to set it up.\n\n### Medusa SES Plugin\n\n[Lacey Pevey](https://github.com/pevey) created a plugin that allows you to use AWS Simple Email Service (SES) as a notification provider in your Medusa backend. By using this plugin, you can send emails to the customer when an order is placed, a password reset has been requested, a gift card has been created, and more using AWS SES.\n\nThe templates used for the emails are stored within your Medusa backend in a `data` directory, and they’re based on handlebars. So, they’re compatible with SendGrid templates as well.\n\nCheck out the [Medusa SES Plugin](https://medusajs.com/plugins/medusa-plugin-ses/) for more details about its features and how to install it.\n\n### Medusa SvelteKit Client\n\nWe also got a much-requested SvelteKit client that lets you interact with your Medusa backend from a SvelteKit storefront. With this client, you can easily build a SvelteKit storefront or admin for your Medusa backend.\n\nSvelteKit enables you to combine the fluid user experience of client-side reactivity with the ability to handle logic on the server when desired. This keeps your Medusa backend firewall-protected and accessible only to your storefront server, which provides an additional layer of security compared to directly exposing your backend.\n\nCheck out the [Medusa SvelteKit Client](https://medusajs.com/plugins/sveltekit-medusa-client/) for more details about its features and how to install it.

Please check the recipe in our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\nMedusa is the set of commerce building blocks that developers can use to create their custom use case. Instead of forcing developers to use a standardized solution, leading them to enforce hacky-workarounds, Medusa embraces customization and extendability.\n\nThis tutorial gives an example of Medusa's extensibility, showcasing how you can create a marketplace with our building blocks. While the steps in this tutorial may not lead to a fully-fledged marketplace, they will give you an idea of how it can be implemented by building the foundation. You’ll also find other resources at the end of the tutorial that can guide you through the rest of your marketplace development.\n\n\u003e Last year, we wrote a blog about how to create a marketplace with Medusa and Medusa Extender. At the time, Medusa did not provide the necessary functionalities to extend its core, which required developers to use Medusa Extender. With the release of [v1.8 of Medusa](https://medusajs.com/recap/), the marketplace can now be built with Medusa only. This tutorial illustrates how to do that.\n\nThe code of this tutorial is available in [this ](https://github.com/shahednasser/medusa-1.8-marketplace-tutorial)[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/shahednasser/medusa-1.8-marketplace-tutorial).\n\n## What You’ll be Building\n\nBy following along the steps in this tutorial, you’ll be implementing the following logic:\n\n1.  Every time a user is created, a new store associated with that user is created.\n2.  When the user retrieves the store’s details, their store’s details will be retrieved.\n3.  Every time a product is created, it is associated with the store of the logged-in user.\n4.  The user will only be able to retrieve products from their store.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThis article assumes you already have a Medusa backend with v1.8 of Medusa installed. If not, you can learn how to install it [here](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/backend/install).\n\n## Extend the Store Entity\n\nIn this section, you’ll extend the Store entity so that you can later add new relations to it. Extending an entity requires extending its repository as well.\n\nYou can learn more about extending an entity in [our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/entities/extend-entity).\n\nCreate the file `src/models/store.ts` with the following content:\n\n```ts\nimport { Entity } from \"typeorm\"\nimport {\n  Store as MedusaStore,\n} from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\n\n@Entity()\nexport class Store extends MedusaStore {\n  // TODO add relations\n}\n```\n\nThis imports the `Store` entity from the Medusa core package as `MedusaStore` and creates a new `Store` entity that extends it.\n\n### Extend the StoreRepository\n\nNext, create the file `src/repositories/store.ts` with the following content:\n\n```ts\nimport { Store } from \"../models/store\"\nimport { \n  dataSource,\n} from \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/loaders/database\"\nimport {\n  StoreRepository as MedusaStoreRepository,\n} from \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/repositories/store\"\n\nexport const StoreRepository = dataSource\n  .getRepository(Store)\n  .extend({\n    ...Object.assign(\n      MedusaStoreRepository, \n      { target: Store }\n    ),\n  })\n\nexport default StoreRepository\n```\n\nThis imports the `StoreRepository` from the Medusa core package as `MedusaStoreRepository`, then extends the repository to target the new `Store` entity you created.\n\n### Create index.d.ts\n\nFinally, to ensure TypeScript is aware of the new type you’re creating, create the file `src/index.d.ts` with the following content:\n\n```ts\nexport declare module \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/models/store\" {\n  declare interface Store {\n    // TODO add relations\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou’ll later add relations to the `Store` interface as you add them to the `Store` entity. You’ll also be using the same file when extending other entities.\n\n## Extend the User Entity\n\nNext, you’ll extend the user entity to add a new column and relation to the `Store` entity. The steps are the same as the ones described in the previous section.\n\nStart by creating the `src/models/user.ts` file with the following content:\n\n```ts\nimport { Column, Entity, Index, JoinColumn, ManyToOne } from \"typeorm\"\nimport {\n  User as MedusaUser,\n} from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\nimport { Store } from \"./store\";\n\n@Entity()\nexport class User extends MedusaUser {\n  @Index(\"UserStoreId\")\n  @Column({ nullable: true })\n  store_id?: string;\n\n  @ManyToOne(() =\u003e Store, (store) =\u003e store.members)\n  @JoinColumn({ name: 'store_id', referencedColumnName: 'id' })\n  store?: Store;\n}\n```\n\nThis imports the `User` entity from the Medusa core package as `MedusaUser` and creates a new entity `User` that extends it. In the entity, you add a new column `store_id` and a relation `store` to the `Store` entity.\n\nThen, in the `Store` entity created in `src/models/store.ts`, add the following relation to the entity:\n\n```ts\nimport { Entity, OneToMany } from \"typeorm\"\nimport { User } from \"./user\";\n// other imports...\n\n@Entity()\nexport class Store extends MedusaStore {\n\t@OneToMany(() =\u003e User, (user) =\u003e user?.store)\n  members?: User[];\n}\n```\n\nYou might see some TypeScript errors in your editor now. This can be resolved by replacing the content of the `src/index.d.ts` with the following content:\n\n```ts\nexport declare module \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/models/store\" {\n  declare interface Store {\n    members?: User[];\n  }\n}\n\nexport declare module \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/models/user\" {\n  declare interface User {\n    store_id?: string;\n    store?: Store;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis informs TypeScript that the `User` entity now has `store_id` and `store` properties, and the `Store` entity has a `members` property. You can learn more [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html).\n\n### Extend the UserRepository\n\nNext, create the file `src/repositories/user.ts` with the following content:\n\n```ts\nimport { User } from \"../models/user\"\nimport { \n  dataSource,\n} from \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/loaders/database\"\nimport {\n  UserRepository as MedusaUserRepository,\n} from \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/repositories/user\"\n\nexport const UserRepository = dataSource\n  .getRepository(User)\n  .extend({\n    ...Object.assign(\n      MedusaUserRepository, \n      { target: User }\n    ),\n  })\n\nexport default UserRepository\n```\n\nThis imports the `UserRepository` from the Medusa core package as `MedusaUserRepository` and creates a new `UserRepository` that extends it but targets the new `User` entity.\n\n### Create Migration for the User Entity\n\nSince you’re adding a new column `store_id` to the `User` entity, you must add a new migration that reflects that column in your database.\n\nYou can learn more about migrations in [our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/entities/migrations/overview).\n\nFirst, run the following command in the root directory of your backend:\n\n```bash\nnpx typeorm migration:create src/migrations/add-user-store-id\n```\n\nThis will create a new file under `src/migrations`. The file’s name should be of the format `\u003cTIMESTAMP\u003e_UserChanged.ts`.\n\nIn the file, there’s a migration class with two methods: `up` and `down`. Replace the methods with the following content:\n\n```ts\npublic async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE \"user\" ADD \"store_id\" character varying`);\n    await queryRunner.query(`CREATE INDEX \"UserStoreId\" ON \"user\" (\"store_id\") `);\n}\n\npublic async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    await queryRunner.query(`DROP INDEX \"public\".\"UserStoreId\"`);\n    await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE \"user\" DROP COLUMN \"store_id\"`);\n}\n```\n\nBefore you run the migrations, run the `build` command which transpiles the files under the `src` directory into the `dist` directory:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThen, run the migration command:\n\n```bash\nmedusa migrations run\n```\n\nThis will add the new `store_id` column to the `user` table.\n\n## Create Middleware to Register Logged-In User\n\nTo get access to the logged-in user across your services, you need to register it through a middleware. This middleware will run on all endpoints under the `/admin` path, except for the `/admin/auth` endpoints.\n\nYou can learn more about middlewares in [our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/endpoints/add-middleware).\n\nStart by creating the file `src/api/middlewares/logged-in-user.ts` with the following content:\n\n```ts\nimport { UserService } from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\nimport { User } from \"../../models/user\"\n\nexport async function registerLoggedInUser(req, res, next) {\n  let loggedInUser: User | null = null\n\n  if (req.user \u0026\u0026 req.user.userId) {\n    const userService = \n      req.scope.resolve(\"userService\") as UserService\n    loggedInUser = await userService.retrieve(req.user.userId)\n  }\n\n  req.scope.register({\n    loggedInUser: {\n      resolve: () =\u003e loggedInUser,\n     },\n   })\n  \n  next()\n}\n```\n\nThis retrieves the logged-in user from `req.user.userId` and, if available, registers it in Medusa’s dependency container under `loggedInUser`.\n\nYou can learn more about the dependency container and injection in [our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/fundamentals/dependency-injection).\n\nNext, create the file `src/api/index.ts` with the following content:\n\n```ts\nimport { Router } from \"express\"\nimport configLoader from \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/loaders/config\"\nimport { \n  registerLoggedInUser,\n} from \"./middlewares/logged-in-user\"\nimport \n  authenticate \nfrom \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/api/middlewares/authenticate\"\nimport * as cors from \"cors\"\n\nexport default function (rootDirectory: string) {\n  const router = Router()\n  const config = configLoader(rootDirectory)\n\n  const adminCors = {\n    origin: config.projectConfig.admin_cors.split(\",\"),\n    credentials: true,\n  }\n\n  router.use(\n    /\\/admin\\/[^(auth)].*/,\n    cors(adminCors),\n    authenticate(),\n    registerLoggedInUser\n  )\n\n  return router\n}\n```\n\nThis registers the middleware on all paths starting with `/admin` except for `/admin/auth` paths. Notice that you also add the `authenticate` middleware before the `registerLoggedInUser` middleware. The `authenticate` middleware authenticates the user and sets `req.user`. If not added, the `registerLoggedInUser` middleware will not be able to access the logged-in user.\n\nYou’ll see the middleware’s work in action when you start customizing services in the upcoming sections.\n\n## Extend Store Service\n\nIn this section, you’ll extend the `Store` service to change the logic behind retrieving a store. In the Medusa core package, it’s assumed there’s one store and so the first store is retrieved. You’ll be changing that to retrieve the store of the logged-in user.\n\nYou can learn more about extending services in [the documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/services/extend-service).\n\nCreate the file `src/services/store.ts` with the following content:\n\n```ts\nimport { Lifetime } from \"awilix\"\nimport { \n  FindConfig,\n  StoreService as MedusaStoreService, Store, User,\n} from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\n\nclass StoreService extends MedusaStoreService {\n  static LIFE_TIME = Lifetime.SCOPED\n  protected readonly loggedInUser_: User | null\n\n  constructor(container, options) {\n    // @ts-expect-error prefer-rest-params\n    super(...arguments)\n\n    try {\n      this.loggedInUser_ = container.loggedInUser\n    } catch (e) {\n      // avoid errors when backend first runs\n    }\n  }\n\n  async retrieve(config?: FindConfig\u003cStore\u003e): Promise\u003cStore\u003e {\n    if (!this.loggedInUser_) {\n      return super.retrieve(config);\n    }\n\n    return this.retrieveForLoggedInUser(config);\n  }\n\n  async retrieveForLoggedInUser (config?: FindConfig\u003cStore\u003e) {\n    const storeRepo = this.manager_.withRepository(this.storeRepository_);\n    const store = await storeRepo.findOne({\n        ...config,\n        relations: [\n          ...config.relations,\n          'members'\n        ],\n        where: {\n          id: this.loggedInUser_.store_id\n        },\n    });\n\n    if (!store) {\n        throw new Error('Unable to find the user store');\n    }\n\n    return store\n  }\n}\n\nexport default StoreService\n```\n\nYou import the `StoreService` from the Medusa core package as `MedusaStoreService`. You then create a new `StoreService` class that extends `MedusaStoreService`.\n\nIn the class, you set the `LIFE_TIME` of the service to `Lifetime.SCOPED`. This is necessary for the service to access the registered `loggedInUser`. You can learn more about it in [the documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/services/create-service#service-life-time).\n\nYou also add a new class attribute `loggedInUser_` and set its value in the constructor. Notice that you wrap the initialization of `loggedInUser_` in the constructor with a try-catch block to avoid errors when the `loggedInUser` is not registered in the Medusa container.\n\nYou then override the `retrieve` method. In that method:\n\n1.  You check if the `loggedInUser_` is set. If not, you call the `retrieve` method of the service from the core package.\n2.  If the `loggedInUser_` is set, you retrieve the store using a new method `retrieveForLoggedInUser`. This method retrieves the store using the value of `store_id` of the `loggedInUser_` and expands the `members` relation.\n\nBefore you test out this method, you should create the logic that associate a new user with a new store.\n\n## Extend the User Service\n\nIn this section, you’ll implement the logic behind creating a store for every new user. To do this, you’ll extend the `UserService` from the Medusa core to override the `create` method.\n\nCreate the file `src/services/user.ts` with the following content:\n\n```ts\nimport { Lifetime } from \"awilix\"\nimport { UserService as MedusaUserService } from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\nimport { User } from \"../models/user\"\nimport { CreateUserInput as MedusaCreateUserInput } from \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/types/user\"\nimport StoreRepository from \"../repositories/store\"\n\ntype CreateUserInput = {\n  store_id?: string\n} \u0026 MedusaCreateUserInput\n\nclass UserService extends MedusaUserService {\n  static LIFE_TIME = Lifetime.SCOPED\n  protected readonly loggedInUser_: User | null\n  protected readonly storeRepository_: typeof StoreRepository;\n\n  constructor(container, options) {\n    // @ts-expect-error prefer-rest-params\n    super(...arguments)\n    this.storeRepository_ = container.storeRepository\n\n    try {\n      this.loggedInUser_ = container.loggedInUser\n    } catch (e) {\n      // avoid errors when backend first runs\n    }\n  }\n\n  async create(user: CreateUserInput, password: string): Promise\u003cUser\u003e {\n    if (!user.store_id) {\n      const storeRepo = this.manager_.withRepository(this.storeRepository_)\n      let newStore = storeRepo.create()\n      newStore = await storeRepo.save(newStore)\n      user.store_id = newStore.id\n    }\n\n    return await super.create(user, password)\n  }\n}\n\nexport default UserService\n```\n\nIn this file you:\n\n1.  Extend the core’s `UserService` which is imported as `MedusaUserService`.\n2.  You change the value of the `LIFE_TIME` attribute of the service. This is explained in the Extend Store Service section.\n3.  You add a new `loggedInUser_` attribute and initialize it in the constructor.\n4.  You override the `create` method. In the method, you first check if the `user` does not have a `store_id`. This allows you to specifically set the store of the user in other places if necessary. This can be helpful if you’re creating a team of users in one store. If the user doesn’t have `store_id` set, a new store is created and the `store_id` property of the user is set to the ID of the new store. The user is saved then using the logic implemented in the core service.\n\n## Test Store-User Relation\n\nTime to test everything you’ve implemented so far. To do that, run the `build` and the `start` commands in your Medusa backend:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build \u0026\u0026 npm start\n```\n\nOnce your Medusa backend starts, login with any admin user that you have using the [User Login endpoint](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#tag/Auth/operation/PostAuth). If you’ve seeded your database with demo data, you should have the following login credentials:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"email\": \"admin@medusa-test.com\",\n    \"password\": \"supersecret\"\n}\n```\n\nNotice that when you log in, the `store_id` of the user is set to `null`.\n\nThen, try to get the store’s data using the [Get Store Details endpoint](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#tag/Store/operation/GetStore). The default store will be returned, which has an empty `members` array.\n\n![](/images/OX8ssLkIVT.png)\n\nNext, try to create a new user using the [Create a User endpoint](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#tag/Users/operation/PostUsers). You should see that the new user has a set `store_id`.\n\n![](/images/etbiKy1y-V.png)\n\nNow, try to login with your new user, then try to retrieve the store’s data using the Get Store Details endpoint as mentioned earlier. You’ll see now that a different store is retrieved than the first time. This is the store that was created for this new user. It also has the new user as part of its `members` array.\n\n![](/images/qbgFHLKKEe.png)\n\nThe user-store relation is now established and ready for use. Next, you’ll be working on the product-store relation.\n\n## Extend the Product Entity\n\nIn this section, you’ll extend the `Product` entity to add a new column and relation to the `Store`. The process will be very similar to that of extending the `User` entity.\n\nStart by creating the file `src/models/product.ts` with the following content:\n\n```ts\nimport { Column, Entity, Index, JoinColumn, ManyToOne } from \"typeorm\"\nimport {\n  Product as MedusaProduct,\n} from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\nimport { Store } from \"./store\";\n\n@Entity()\nexport class Product extends MedusaProduct {\n  @Index(\"ProductStoreId\")\n  @Column({ nullable: true })\n  store_id?: string;\n\n  @ManyToOne(() =\u003e Store, (store) =\u003e store.products)\n  @JoinColumn({ name: 'store_id', referencedColumnName: 'id' })\n  store?: Store;\n}\n```\n\nThis imports the `Product` entity from the Medusa core package as `MedusaProduct` and creates a new entity `Product` that extends it. In the entity, you add a new column `store_id` and a relation `store` to the `Store` entity.\n\nThen, in the `Store` entity created in `src/models/store.ts`, add the following relation to the entity:\n\n```ts\nimport { Product } from \"./product\";\n// other imports...\n\n@Entity()\nexport class Store extends MedusaStore {\n\t// other relation...\n\n\t@OneToMany(() =\u003e Product, (product) =\u003e product?.store)\n  products?: Product[];\n}\n```\n\nYou might see some TypeScript errors in your editor now. This can be resolved by adding the `products` relation to the `Store` interface and adding a new declaration for the `Product` in `index.d.ts`:\n\n```ts\nexport declare module \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/models/store\" {\n  declare interface Store {\n    members?: User[];\n    products?: Product[];\n  }\n}\n\n// user declaration...\n\nexport declare module \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/models/product\" {\n  declare interface Product {\n    store_id?: string;\n    store?: Store;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Extend the ProductRepository\n\nNext, create the file `src/repositories/product.ts` with the following content:\n\n```ts\nimport { Product } from \"../models/product\"\nimport { \n  dataSource,\n} from \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/loaders/database\"\nimport {\n  ProductRepository as MedusaProductRepository,\n} from \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/repositories/product\"\n\nexport const ProductRepository = dataSource\n  .getRepository(Product)\n  .extend({\n    ...Object.assign(\n      MedusaProductRepository, \n      { target: Product }\n    ),\n  })\n\nexport default ProductRepository\n```\n\nThis imports the `ProductRepository` from the Medusa core package as `MedusaProductRepository` and creates a new `ProductRepository` that extends it but targets the new `Product` entity.\n\n### Create Migration for the Product Entity\n\nSince you’re adding a new column `store_id` to the `Product` entity, you must add a new migration that reflects that column in your database.\n\nFirst, run the following command in the root directory of your backend:\n\n```bash\nnpx typeorm migration:create src/migrations/ProductChanged\n```\n\nThis will create a new file under `src/migrations`. The file’s name should be of the format `\u003cTIMESTAMP\u003e_ProductChanged.ts`.\n\nIn the file, there’s a migration class with two methods: `up` and `down`. Replace the methods with the following content:\n\n```ts\npublic async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE \"product\" ADD \"store_id\" character varying`);\n    await queryRunner.query(`CREATE INDEX \"ProductStoreId\" ON \"product\" (\"store_id\") `);\n}\n\npublic async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    await queryRunner.query(`DROP INDEX \"public\".\"ProductStoreId\"`);\n    await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE \"product\" DROP COLUMN \"store_id\"`);\n}\n```\n\nBefore you run the migrations, run the `build` command which transpiles the files under the `src` directory into the `dist` directory:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThen, run the migration command:\n\n```bash\nmedusa migrations run\n```\n\nThis will add the new `store_id` column to the `product` table.\n\n## Extend the Product Service\n\nIn this section, you’ll extend the product service to do two things:\n\n1.  Change the `save` logic to attach the product to the logged-in user’s store.\n2.  Change the methods used to retrieve products including the `list`, `listAndCount`, and `retrieve` methods to retrieve the products only associated with the logged-in user’s store.\n\nCreate the file `src/services/product.ts` with the following content:\n\n```ts\nimport { Lifetime } from \"awilix\"\nimport { \n  ProductService as MedusaProductService, Product, User,\n} from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\nimport { CreateProductInput as MedusaCreateProductInput, FindProductConfig, ProductSelector as MedusaProductSelector } from \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/types/product\"\n\ntype ProductSelector = {\n  store_id?: string\n} \u0026 MedusaProductSelector\n\ntype CreateProductInput = {\n  store_id?: string\n} \u0026 MedusaCreateProductInput\n\nclass ProductService extends MedusaProductService {\n  static LIFE_TIME = Lifetime.SCOPED\n  protected readonly loggedInUser_: User | null\n\n  constructor(container, options) {\n    // @ts-expect-error prefer-rest-params\n    super(...arguments)\n\n    try {\n      this.loggedInUser_ = container.loggedInUser\n    } catch (e) {\n      // avoid errors when backend first runs\n    }\n  }\n\n  async list(selector: ProductSelector, config?: FindProductConfig): Promise\u003cProduct[]\u003e {\n    if (!selector.store_id \u0026\u0026 this.loggedInUser_?.store_id) {\n      selector.store_id = this.loggedInUser_.store_id\n    }\n\n    config.select?.push('store_id')\n\n    config.relations?.push('store')\n\n    return await super.list(selector, config)\n  }\n\n  async listAndCount(selector: ProductSelector, config?: FindProductConfig): Promise\u003c[Product[], number]\u003e {\n    if (!selector.store_id \u0026\u0026 this.loggedInUser_?.store_id) {\n      selector.store_id = this.loggedInUser_.store_id\n    }\n\n    config.select?.push('store_id')\n\n    config.relations?.push('store')\n\n    return await super.listAndCount(selector, config)\n  }\n\n  async retrieve(productId: string, config?: FindProductConfig): Promise\u003cProduct\u003e {\n    config.relations = [\n      ...(config.relations || []),\n      'store'\n    ]\n\n    const product = await super.retrieve(productId, config);\n\n    if (product.store?.id \u0026\u0026 this.loggedInUser_?.store_id \u0026\u0026 product.store.id !== this.loggedInUser_.store_id) {\n      // Throw error if you don't want a product to be accessible to other stores\n      throw new Error('Product does not exist in store.');\n    }\n\n    return product\n  }\n\n  async create(productObject: CreateProductInput): Promise\u003cProduct\u003e {\n    if (!productObject.store_id \u0026\u0026 this.loggedInUser_?.store_id) {\n      productObject.store_id = this.loggedInUser_.store_id\n    }\n\n    return await super.create(productObject);\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ProductService\n```\n\nIn this file you:\n\n1.  Extend the core’s `ProductService` which is imported as `MedusaProductService`.\n2.  You change the value of the `LIFE_TIME` attribute of the service. This is explained in the Extend Store Service section.\n3.  You add a new `loggedInUser_` attribute and initialize it in the constructor.\n4.  You override the `list` and `listAndCount` methods to filter the retrieved products by the logged-in user’s store ID. You also ensure that the `store_id` attribute is retrieved as part of the product and that the `store` relation is expanded.\n5.  You override the `retrieve` method to check if the retrieved product belongs to the logged-in user’s store. If not, you throw an error that the product does not exist.\n6.  You override the `create` method to check if the logged-in user has a store and, if so, associate the product’s store ID with that store.\n\n\u003e Notice that you didn’t implement the `save` mechanism as part of the repository this time. This is because the repository does not have access to the Medusa container. So, you won’t be able to access the logged-in user in it.\n\n## Test the Product-Store Relation\n\nYou can now test the relation between the product and the store.\n\nStart by running the `build` and `start` commands in the root of your Medusa backend:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build \u0026\u0026 npm start\n```\n\nThen, log in as a user who has a store as explained in the previous testing section.\n\nAfter that, retrieve the available products by sending a request to the [List Products](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#tag/Products/operation/GetProducts) endpoint. You’ll see that there are no products returned, even if you previously had products in your store. This is because these products are not associated with the user’s store.\n\n![](/images/xVOk-B0b72.png)\n\nThen, try creating a new product using the [Create Product](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#tag/Products/operation/PostProducts) endpoint. You’ll see that the created product has a `store` attribute. The `id` of that store is the same ID of the user’s store.\n\n![](/images/YJ1vvpKLNF.png)\n\nIf you try retrieving the list of products again, you’ll find your newly-created product in the returned array.\n\n![](/images/wtqAmWmbrb.png)\n\n### Note About Super-Admin User\n\nSo far in your implementation you’ve taken into accoun utsers that don’t have a set store ID. These are considered “super-admin” users. These users would be able to view all products in the store and the default store’s details.\n\nIf this logic does not work for you, make sure to change the implementation to require a store ID for a user in the different locations we’ve used it.\n\n## What’s Next\n\nIn this tutorial, you learned how to implement the foundation of a marketplace: having multiple stores, different users within those stores, and associating products with a store.\n\nA marketplace has a variety of other features, each depending on your use case. Some of them are:\n\n*   Create order-store relation: This requires a similar implementation as what you’ve done in this tutorial with products and users. You need to extend the `Order` entity to include a relation to the store. You can learn more about extending entities in [the documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/entities/extend-entity).\n*   List orders by stores: This requires a similar implementation as what you’ve done in this tutorial with products. You need to extend the `OrderService` to override the methods used to retrieve orders. You can learn more about extending services in [the documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/services/extend-service).\n*   Associate an order to a store: This requires listening to the `order.created` event in a subscriber. The implementation can include creating child orders of an order if in your use case you support have products from multiple stores in one product. In this case, you’d also need to extend the order entity to create a parent-child relation. You can learn more about subscribers in [the documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/events/subscribers).\n*   Implement teams within a store: You can implement a team within a store by extending the `Invite` entity to associate it with a store ID, then associate the user created from the invite with that store ID.\n\nThese are just some ideas and direction for your development of the marketplace. For further help in your development, make sure to check out the available guides in [our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/).\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/announcing-admin-plugin.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/announcing-admin-plugin.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/announcing-admin-plugin.md"},"title":"Announcing Admin plugin","date":"2023-04-04","excerpt":"We're excited to announce a new plugin that provides developers with a better way to manage and deploy Admin for Medusa stores.","darkTheme":true,"type":"PostLayout","bottomSections":[{"type":"RecentPostsSection","variant":"variant-b","colors":"colors-a","title":"Want to know more about Medusa","subtitle":"Find related blog posts below","recentCount":6,"showExcerpt":true,"showImage":false,"styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"wide","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-12","pb-20","sm:pb-56","pr-4","pl-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"center"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"center","color":"grey-40"},"actions":{"justifyContent":"center"}}}],"featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/admin-plugin.jpg","altText":"Announcing admin plugin","caption":"Caption of the image","objectFit":"cover","elementId":"","height":0,"width":0},"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-5u6je47u2.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-5u6je47u2.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-5u6je47u2.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Kasper","image":{"url":"/images/Kasper.webp","altText":"Person photo"},"lastName":"Kristensen","role":"SW Engineer"}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json"},"name":"Product","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"We're excited to announce a new plugin that provides developers with a better way to manage and deploy Admin for Medusa stores.\n\nThis plugin introduces a new approach for shipping the dashboard and lays the groundwork for other product improvements planned for Admin later this year. Specifically, we plan to support admin extensibility, essential for enabling developers to build rich commerce applications. With the ability to extend the admin UI with plugins and extensions, developers will be able to create solutions that meet their end-to-end use cases.\n\nAlthough admin extensibility is still in development, this initial step provides developers with more options and improves the developer experience of deploying and maintaining Admin.\n\n## Seamless Updates\n\nWith the move to distributing Medusa’s Admin through `npm` we will also ensure that Medusa Admin is versioned. Prior to this release, the dashboard was available through a GitHub repository, and users must keep up with the latest changes. This has sometimes led to version mismatches and incompatibilities between the UI and server.\n\nWith the new introduction of admin as an NPM package, users can update their admin with a single command. The plugin's versioning follows major and minor updates to the Medusa core, ensuring users can update their admin without worrying about compatibility issues.\n\n## Flexible Deployment Options\n\nDevelopers have two options for deploying Admin using the plugin. They can either integrate it as a part of their server, where the dashboard is directly served from an endpoint, or they can use the plugin as a build tool and deploy the dashboard to a hosting service such as [Vercel](https://docs.medusajs.com/deployments/admin/deploying-on-vercel).\n\nUsers can also combine both options. They can use integrated hosting while in development to have a simple development environment when building with Medusa. Later, they can opt for deploying to an external host in production to leverage modern infrastructure tools.\n\n## An Integrated Part of Your Store\n\nMedusa’s mission is to equip developers with the necessary tools to create robust commerce applications. Medusa's extensible core makes this possible. With this plugin, we're bringing Admin closer to the core. This opens the door to many new, exciting possibilities, including allowing developers to create admin extensions directly from their server directory or through plugins. This will give plugin maintainers the ability to create end-to-end extensions. We're currently in the process of creating a new Extensions API, and we'll share more on this soon.\n\n## Trying it Out\n\nAs mentioned, the plugin provides developers with two options for deployment. In this section, we will cover how to host Admin as an integrated part of your server. For information on deploying Admin to an external host, please refer to our [documentation].\n\n## Installing the Plugin\n\nTo install the plugin, use your preferred package manager:\n\n```bash\nyarn add @medusajs/admin\n```\n\nThen configure it in `medusa-config.js`:\n\n```js\nconst plugins = [\n  // ...\n  \"@medusajs/admin\"\n];\n```\n\nIn `package.json` we need to add a new script to build the dashboard:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n\t// ...\n\t\"build:admin\": \"medusa-admin build\"\n}\n```\n\nWe can now build Admin and start up our server\n\n```bash\nyarn build:admin\nyarn start\n```\n\nThe dashboard can now be accessed from your browser. If you run Medusa on the default port, the URL is ``.\n\n![](/images/FtMuPMrHJ1.png)\n\n## What's next?\n\nWe have several exciting improvements planned for the Admin in the coming months. Currently, we are improving our design system and will ship a new component library to go along with it. Our goals are to enhance the overall look and feel of the dashboard and its responsiveness, and to introduce a new dark mode theme. The new component library will be open-sourced, and we hope developers will find it useful when creating admin extensions once the Extensions API is released later this year.\n\nFor a full overview of what we have planned for Admin and Medusa, you can read more on our [GitHub discussions page](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/discussions/categories/roadmap). We would love to hear any feedback and ideas you might have for the next features we are working on, so please do not hesitate to share them with us.\n\nYou can learn more about the [admin plugin in our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/quickstart).\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/announcing-cache-modules.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/announcing-cache-modules.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/announcing-cache-modules.md"},"title":"Announcing Cache Modules","date":"2023-04-04","excerpt":"We are excited to announce that we introduced cache modules into Medusa.

With the latest evolution of our toolkit towards a more modular architecture, we are taking steps to make Medusa more agnostic to infrastructure. As a big step in this direction, we are excited to announce Medusa’s new cache modules.\n\nIn this article, we will look under the hood to see how cache modules work, which cache module you can use in your project today, and, finally, we will demonstrate how easily a Memcached module can be built.\n\n## How it works\n\nCache modules in Medusa implement the [`ICacheService`](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/blob/develop/packages/types/src/cache/service.ts) interface and are used internally to cache data like product prices and tax rates.\n\nMedusa’s default starter project comes with an in-memory cache module (`@medusajs/cache-inmemory`) pre-installed, which uses a plain JavaScript Map object to store data. This is great for testing and development purposes, but not recommended for production environments. You can have one cache module installed at a time and for production environments, we have built a cache module that uses Redis (`@medusajs/cache-redis`). To enable the Redis cache module, simply install the package:\n\n```bash\nyarn add @medusajs/cache-redis\n```\n\nAnd configure it in your `medusa-config.js` file:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  //...\n  modules: {\n  \t// ...\n\t\t\"cacheService\": {\n\t\t\tresolve: \"@medusajs/cache-redis\",\n\t\t\toptions: { ttl: 30, redisUrl: REDIS_URL }\n\t\t}\n\t},\n};\n```\n\nAnd that’s it. With just a couple of changed config lines, you use a different data store for our caching layer.\n\n## Building a cache module\n\nAs mentioned above, we are making in-memory and Redis cache modules available today. Building a new cache module is, however, very easy if you have a different caching tool in place already or prefer another caching technology. To demonstrate how to build a cache module, we will implement `ICacheService` to work with Memcached. For communication with the Memcached instance, we will be using the [Memcached client for Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/memcached).\n\nThe first thing to do is to create our project. We need a basic TypeScript project configured for Node. You can clone a preconfigured starter [here](https://github.com/fPolic/medusa-cache-memcached/tree/setup), and after running `yarn install`, start building.\n\nTo implement the service, create a new TypeScript file in `src/services`:\n\n```ts\n// src/services/memcached-cache.ts\n\nimport Memcached from \"memcached\" // 1. Memcached client\nimport { ICacheService } from \"@medusajs/medusa\" // 2. Interface from medusa core that all caching modules need to implement\n\nconst DEFAULT_CACHE_TIME = 30 // 3. Keep data cached for 30 seconds\n\n/**\n * 4. Module config type.\n * Defines which options can be passed to the module in the medusa-config file.\n */\ntype MemcachedCacheModuleOptions = {\n  /**\n   * Time to keep data in the cache (in seconds)\n   */\n  ttl?: number\n\n\t/**\n\t\t* Allow passing the configuration for Memcached client\n\t\t*/\n  location: Memcached.Location\n  options?: Memcached.options\n}\n\ntype InjectedDependencies = {}\n\nclass MemcachedCacheService implements ICacheService {\n  protected readonly memcached: Memcached\n  protected readonly TTL: number\n\n  constructor(\n\t\t{}: InjectedDependencies,\n    options: MemcachedCacheModuleOptions // 5. Options passed as module config will be injected here by the modules loader\n  ) {\n    this.memcached = new Memcached(options.location, options.options) // 6. Instantiate Memcached client for communication with the Memcached instance\n    this.TTL = options.ttl || DEFAULT_CACHE_TIME\n  }\n\n /**\n   * Set a key/value pair to the cache.\n   * It is also possible to manage the `ttl` through environment variables using CACHE_TTL. If the ttl is 0 it will\n   * act like the value should not be cached at all.\n   */\n  async set(\n    key: string,\n    data: Record\u003cstring, unknown\u003e,\n    ttl: number = this.TTL\n  ): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    return new Promise((res, rej) =\u003e\n      this.memcached.set(key, JSON.stringify(data), ttl, (err) =\u003e {\n        if (err) {\n          rej(err)\n        } else {\n          res()\n        }\n      })\n    )\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Retrieve a cached value belonging to the given key.\n   */\n\tasync get\u003cT\u003e(cacheKey: string): Promise\u003cT | null\u003e {\n    return new Promise((res, rej) =\u003e {\n      this.memcached.get(cacheKey, (err, data) =\u003e {\n        if (err) {\n          res(null)\n        } else {\n          if (data) {\n            res(JSON.parse(data))\n          } else {\n            res(null)\n          }\n        }\n      })\n    })\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Invalidate cache for a specific key.\n   */\n  async invalidate(key: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    return new Promise((res, rej) =\u003e {\n      this.memcached.del(key, (err) =\u003e {\n        if (err) {\n          rej(err)\n        } else {\n          res()\n        }\n      })\n    })\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MemcachedCacheService\n```\n\nAnd that’s it. The final thing to add is export from the `index.ts` file like so:\n\n```ts\n// src/index.ts\n\nimport { ModuleExports } from \"@medusajs/modules-sdk\"\n\nimport { MemcachedCacheService } from \"./services\"\n\nconst service = MemcachedCacheService\n\nconst moduleDefinition: ModuleExports = {\n  service,\n}\n\nexport default moduleDefinition\n```\n\nYou can find the entire implementation [here](https://github.com/fPolic/medusa-cache-memcached/blob/main/src/services/memcached-cache.ts).\n\nTo test the module with a Medusa instance, [link](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/link/) your module project with a Medusa instance:\n\n```bash\n// first build the package from the root\nyarn build\n\n// register package\nyarn link\n```\n\nNext, we need to add this package to our Medusa project and tweak our `medusa-config.js` file:\n\n```bash\n// in the root of your Medusa project run:\nyarn link medusa-cache-memcached\n```\n\n```js\n// medusa-config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ...\n  modules:{ \n\t\t// ...\n\t\t\"cacheService\": \n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tresolve: \"medusa-cache-memcached\", \n\t\t\t\toptions: { location: \"localhost:55000\" }}\n\t\t\t},\n};\n```\n\nWith this example, we see how straightforward it is to build a (cache) module for Medusa. This, combined with the fact that Medusa is an open-source project, shows the advantages users of such projects have in terms of a growing ecosystem of existing modules.\n\n## What’s next\n\nThe introduction of cache modules is a step in adding infrastructure agnosticism to Medusa’s architecture. This will make it easier to integrate Medusa into existing stacks and improve the developer experience. Our introduction of [EventBus modules](https://medusajs.com/blog/announcing-event-bus-modules) is a similar evolution to Medusa’s architecture. We are excited to see what you build with these new tools and can’t wait to launch more modules in the near future.\n\nLearn more about [Cache Modules in our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/cache/overview).\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/announcing-event-bus-modules.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/announcing-event-bus-modules.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/announcing-event-bus-modules.md"},"title":"Announcing Event Bus Modules","date":"2023-04-04","excerpt":"We are announcing a significant update and change to the events system of Medusa.","darkTheme":true,"type":"PostLayout","bottomSections":[{"type":"RecentPostsSection","variant":"variant-b","colors":"colors-a","title":"Want to know more about Medusa","subtitle":"Find related blog posts below","recentCount":6,"showExcerpt":true,"showImage":false,"styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"wide","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-12","pb-20","sm:pb-56","pr-4","pl-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"center"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"center","color":"grey-40"},"actions":{"justifyContent":"center"}}}],"featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/event-bus-modules.jpg","altText":"Announcing Event Bus Modules","caption":"Caption of the image","objectFit":"cover","elementId":"","height":0,"width":0},"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json"},"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Juhl","role":"CTO \u0026 Co-founder","image":{"url":"/images/oli.jpeg","altText":"Oliver Juhl"},"type":"Person","bio":"CTO \u0026 Co-founder of Medusa\n"}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json"},"name":"Product","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"Today, we are announcing a significant update and change to the events system of Medusa. We are moving part of the Event Bus from the core package to a separate module. Our continuous efforts to build a more modular and flexible engine motivate the decision.\n\nIn a space with continuous innovations and fierce competition, the ability to adapt your product to changes, run experiments, and leverage new technology becomes highly relevant for businesses to stay ahead (or keep up) with the competition.\n\nTo do so, you need flexibility in your setup.\n\nAt Medusa, we strive to provide merchants and developers with the building blocks to create bespoke experiences. These building blocks give you a strong starting point and are created to be replaced with more advanced functionality as your business grows, and your needs change.\n\nThe flexibility and ease of customization enable businesses to focus on building the best product for their customers without worrying about the typical triennial migration project.\n\nThe Event Bus modules give businesses the freedom to choose the technology to power the events system of Medusa.\n\n## What are modules?\n\nUntil now, Medusa has offered two ways of extending or replacing core functionality with custom implementations or third-party services; through [Strategies](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/batch-jobs/customize-import/) and [Plugins](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/plugins/overview/).\n\nStrategies allow you to override an isolated piece of business logic e.g. cart completion or product import, and plugins are used to build custom features or integrate services with your engine. The latter is especially well-suited for when you want several of the same type of services installed, e.g. payment providers.\n\nModules allow you to replace business domains or specific elements in your stack with pre-built functionality, custom implementations, or third-party providers. They can be shipped through `npm` and are configurable in `medusa-config.js` - similar to plugins.\n\nThe main difference between Modules and Strategies and Plugins, in the context of business domains, is that Modules do not necessarily share application scope and resources with the core. Effectively, this means that a module can live without dependencies on core concepts and be powered by a separate data store.\n\nThis unlocks a multitude of opportunities, as you can power entire domains of Medusa with third-party APIs or custom implementations that fit your organization’s needs. Let’s take user authentication as an example. Separating the Users domain into a module will allow businesses to use providers like Okta to manage everything related to users, authentication, roles, etc. -  without shoehorning an existing feature to work correctly through an integration.\n\nRefer to [our documentation for a detailed walkthrough of the Modules API](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/modules/overview), including setup and building one yourself. In this post, we only briefly explain simple usage and configuration.\n\n## Event Bus module\n\nOne of the first use cases of modules is within the events' domain. We are introducing an Event Bus module enabling businesses to use any available pub/sub technology to power the message broker of Medusa.\n\nWe still offer a fully functional event bus powered by Redis out-of-the-box, but instead of being baked into the core, you must install and configure it.\n\nAdditionally, we are replacing the default event bus, which previously used a mocked Redis instance, with a [local event bus module](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/events/modules/local) powered by the Node EventEmitter. This module is not recommended for a production environment.\n\nYou’ll find more details about the Redis event bus functionality and configuration in [the documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/events/modules/redis).\n\n### Installation\n\nThe following steps should be taken to install the Redis Event Bus and upgrade your existing setup to use the Modules API.\n\nThese are the required steps for any module going forward - unless the module comes with a default package; in that case, you only need to install the `npm` package in your Medusa project.\n\n**Installing the Redis Event Bus**\n\nInstall the Redis event bus with `npm`:\n\n```bash\nyarn add @medusajs/event-bus-redis\n```\n\nConfigure it in `medusa-config.js`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  projectConfig: {\n    database_url: DATABASE_URL,\n\t\t...\n  },\n  modules: {\n    eventBus: {\n      resolve: \"@medusajs/event-bus-redis\",\n\t\t\toptions: {\n        redisUrl: \"redis://...\",\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [\"medusa-payment-stripe\"],\n};\n```\n\nAgain, we won’t cover the details of the configuration in depth - our documentation serves that purpose - but only briefly explain the code snippet above.\n\nWe use the new `modules` property on the project configuration object to specify the modules we want to override or add. The keys of this object are defined and exposed in the core, ensuring that modules are correctly registered.\n\nThe module key for the event bus is, you guessed it, `eventBus`. The value of the key is the module configuration. The `resolve` property points to the package you want to use and can be an `npm` package or a path to a local implementation.\n\nThe `options` property is a set of required and optional settings that are injected into the module. The only required property for the Redis Event Bus is the URL of your Redis instance. Other optional settings can be found in the documentation.\n\nAfter performing these steps, you can restart your Medusa instance, and everything will work as always, but your events system will be configured and powered by our Modules API.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Modules API is a huge step toward a more composable architecture and will play a critical role in all our work as we advance. The Event Bus module is one of the first demonstrations of the API’s capabilities, though it does not do it full justice. The full power of the API will be more evident as we move into the business domains e.g. multi-warehousing. Read the [product announcement here](https://medusajs.com/blog/announcing-multi-warehouse).\n\nThe Event Bus module abstraction is valuable for products and companies that use Medusa as part of their larger system, as they typically have existing messaging infrastructure in place. Giving them the ability to use this infrastructure to power events in Medusa will make the integration easier and reduce costs and stack complexity.\n\nThe abstraction is also valuable for developers unfamiliar with Redis or BullMQ (our message queue library). It allows them to replace the technology of the events system with a framework they are more comfortable with, thus offering a better developer experience.\n\nYou can learn more about [the events system in our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/events/)\n\nGive the new modules a try, and let us know what you think.

This is part of our mission to constantly improve our developer experience and help guide developers in their journey using Medusa.\n\nIn this article, I’ll detail the thought process, planning, and general work that went into revamping our documentation.\n\n![](/images/qysrRNH_A6.gif)\n\n## Problems with the Previous Documentation\n\nA few months back, I wrote an article about [how we improved our documentation](https://medusajs.com/blog/how-we-improved-our-documentation/) at Medusa. In that article, I discussed why and how we decided to take a product approach towards documentation.\n\n![](/images/edwfMn9F4E.png)\n\nThis lead to an improvement to our documentation from its initial state both in design, structure, and development tools and processes.\n\n![](/images/-i90gZaZ2A.png)\n\nHowever, it wasn’t long until we realized that although this was a huge improvement, it was still lacking in different areas.\n\n### Documentation Structure\n\nOur approach to structure was simple: if a documentation page was a tutorial or a guide that informed developers how to perform something, we put it under the “How-to Guides” category; if a documentation page was a conceptual guide explaining how a feature or a tool generally works, we put it under the “Conceptual Guides” category.\n\nAlthough we believe in the beauty of simplicity, this approach was too simple for a solution like Medusa. Medusa is not an ecommerce platform that can be used in a single use case. Medusa provides the building blocks to build commerce applications. It can be used to create a fully-fledged ecommerce system, or some of its modules can be used within a larger microservice or composable architecture.\n\nSo, categorizing documentation pages that may cover topics related to the Medusa backend, the storefront, the admin, or other areas under general categories such as “How-to Guides” or “Conceptual Guides” became limiting. It made it difficult for developers to find the guide they’re looking for in a specific area, and it was misguiding, as it didn’t properly inform developers of the different ways they can use Medusa.\n\n### Documentation Design\n\nThe previous design was a major step-up from the initial design we had, but it mainly lacked in visual elements that can help developers differentiate between different sections or areas of the documentation.\n\nIn addition, while performing user trials — where we ask developers to use our documentation to perform a task in Medusa — we received comments about some confusion while using the sidebar due to how it was designed.\n\n## Planning for the New Documentation\n\nAs documentation is essential for a pleasant developer experience, our documentation team decided it was time to look into how we can improve our documentation.\n\n### Figuring out the Information Architecture\n\nWe started off by building a new information architecture for the documentation. We created a hierarchy of the areas in Medusa, starting from the too-general categories and getting down to specifics.\n\nFor example, in the previous architecture, we stuffed the How-to category with guides that were not remotely related to one another. So, you would find a guide on how to implement a cart in the storefront right next to a guide on how to create an endpoint.\n\nWe started de-structuring that architecture to find the top-level main areas of interest, and work our way down from there. These areas ended up being [Commerce Modules](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/overview) — which covered all guides related to commerce features, such as the implement cart guide — and [Medusa Development](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/overview) — which covered the fundamentals of developing with Medusa, such as the create endpoint guide.\n\nThen, we would dive into the structure of each of these top-level areas and work our way down from there. For example, inside Commerce Modules, the guides should be categorized by each module. Within the category of each module, we categorized the guides based on whether they’re architectural guides or how-to guides, and what areas do these guides tackle (for example, admin or storefront).\n\nTaking this granular approach towards categorizing the documentation can easily become too confusing. So, it was important to also design a journey that allows developers to find their next steps and not get lost within this architecture. This was a combination of writing an informative content structure and providing visual elements and effects to make the journey even clearer to developers.\n\n### Re-designing the Documentation\n\nAfter coming up with the initial draft of our new information architecture, we started working on the design to bring it to life. The redesigning of the documentation involved redesigning existing elements and creating new elements that provided visual values.\n\nFor example, we moved towards using descriptive icons in our main sidebar. We also redesigned the global sidebar within the documentation to ensure the categorizing and hierarchy is visually visible and clear.\n\nPart of the redesign was also maintaining a consistent design system within our products at Medusa. So, the documentation now uses the same design system that products like the Admin use.\n\n### Building the New Documentation\n\nThe last piece of the puzzle was building the new documentation. This included modifying existing functionalities and components, building new components, and reflecting the Medusa design system into the documentation.\n\nOne component we changed was the Feedback component that can be seen at the end of documentation pages. Although this component provided us with insightful feedback from developers using our documentation, we realized that we weren’t actually providing developers with any solutions if they run into any problems.\n\nSo, we revamped the Feedback component that provides possible solutions from closed GitHub issues. The issues are shown either based on the message that the developer enters, or based on the page they’re in.\n\n![](/images/feedback-component.gif)\n\n## The Final Result\n\nThe new documentation was a product of a lot of discussions and brainstorming to come up with an improved developer experience. After numerous rounds of iterations and improvements, we decided to roll out the new documentation.\n\nAs always, this in no way means that the documentation is now perfect or finished, and it should be no surprise if later in the year you find another article on how we — again — improved our documentation. Documentation is a continuous learning and growing experience as we further understand developers using Medusa, and as we further innovate with Medusa.\n\nWe look forward to any feedback you have, which you can always send on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/medusajs), GitHub [issues](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/issues) and [discussion](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/discussions), or using the feedback form within our documentation.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/announcing-modules.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/announcing-modules.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/announcing-modules.md"},"title":"Announcing Modules","date":"2023-04-04","excerpt":"We are thrilled to announce the integration of Modules into Medusa's architecture, which is a leap towards flexibility and robustness.","darkTheme":true,"type":"PostLayout","bottomSections":[{"type":"RecentPostsSection","variant":"variant-b","colors":"colors-a","title":"Want to know more about Medusa","subtitle":"Find related blog posts below","recentCount":6,"showExcerpt":true,"showImage":false,"styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"wide","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-12","pb-20","sm:pb-56","pr-4","pl-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"center"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"center","color":"grey-40"},"actions":{"justifyContent":"center"}}}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-yz371kn2y.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-yz371kn2y.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-yz371kn2y.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Rodrigues","username":"lorem-ipsum","email":"lorem-ipsum","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/37986729.jpeg","altText":"Carlos Rodrigues"}}],"featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/modules.jpg","altText":"Announcing Modules","caption":"Caption of the image","objectFit":"cover","elementId":"","height":0,"width":0},"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json"},"name":"Product","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"We are thrilled to announce the integration of Modules into Medusa's architecture.

They foster separation of concerns, maintainability, and reusability by organizing code into smaller, independent units that can be easily managed, tested, and integrated with other modules.\n\nApplying this concept to Medusa's architecture enables functional components (e.g., Medusa’s cart engine) to be extendable, entirely replaceable, or even capable of running independently of the main application.\n\nA module comes with a definition containing information about its configuration and capabilities.\n\n```ts\n{\n  key: string,\n  registrationName: string,\n  defaultPackage: string,\n  label: string,\n  canOverride: boolean,\n  isRequired: boolean,\n  dependencies: string[],\n  defaultModuleDeclaration: {\n    scope: \"internal\" | \"external\",\n    resources: \"shared\" | \"isolated\",\n  },\n}\n```\n\n| **Property**                            | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `key`                                   | The key to register a module in your `medusa-config.js` file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| `registrationName`                      | The name of the main service of the module and its registration in the `Awilix` dependency container.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| `defaultPackage`                        | If the module comes with a default package, it will be added directly in the definition.

An internal module communicates with other services part of the same application. An external module communicates with other services via a separate protocol e.g. HTTP, rpc, etc.                                                                                                                  |\n| *defaultModuleDeclaration*`resources` | This is only applied to internal modules. A module that shares resources with the core uses the same database connection and the same Awilix container as the core. An isolated module will establish a separate database connection or uses a different data store and its Awilix container will only contain required dependencies from the core. |\n\nModules are loaded in a manner akin to plugins. When the server starts, modules specified in `medusa-config.js` are loaded while adhering to their respective configurations.\n\nThe latest version, v1.8, comes with several modules ready to be installed:\n\n1.  **Inventory**: This module manages inventory for items, supports item reservations, and handles stock levels across multiple locations.\n2.  **Stock Location**: This module handles stock locations for stores with multiple warehouses.\n3.  **Event Bus (Local or Redis)**: A messaging module for publishing and subscribing to Medusa events. The default `module is ideal for local use, while the Redis-based` module is recommended for production environments.\n4.  **Cache (Memory or Redis)**: A caching module designed to store cacheable parts of the application. The default `module stores data in memory, while the` module utilizes Redis for storage and is recommended for production use.\n\n## The Road Ahead\n\nThe development of Modules is progressing rapidly, with numerous intriguing features in the pipeline. Modules that rely on databases can already either share the same database connection as the main application or establish a separate connection. Similarly, developers can choose whether a module will utilize its own dedicated database or share the primary Medusa Core database.\n\nModules will also offer the flexibility to be used within any Nodejs application. Below is an example of the inventory module being initialized and used directly in a Next.js handler:\n\n```ts\nimport { initialize, InventoryServiceInitializeOptions } from \"@medusajs/inventory\";\nimport { IInventoryService } from \"@medusajs/types\";\nimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from \"next\";\n\nlet inventoryService = null;\nasync function getInventoryService(): Promise\u003cIInventoryService\u003e {\n  if (!inventoryService) {\n\t\tconst options: InventoryServiceInitializeOptions = {\n\t\t  database: {\n\t\t    type: \"postgres\",\n\t\t    url: `postgres://postgres:@localhost/inventory`,\n\t\t  },\n\t\t};\n    inventoryService = await initialize(options);\n  }\n  return inventoryService;\n}\n\nexport default async (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) =\u003e {\n  const { sku } = req.query as { sku: string };\n  try {\n    const service = await getInventoryService();\n    const item = await service.createInventoryItem({\n      sku,\n    });\n    res.json({ item });\n  } catch (e) {\n    res.status(400).json({ error: (e as Error).message });\n  }\n};\n```\n\nNonetheless, this method may constrain module development to the same technology stack as Medusa (Node.js, TypeScript, and JavaScript). To attain a truly composable commerce architecture, we plan to support external modules in the future. These external modules will operate as independent services, facilitating communication through HTTP/RPC.\n\nBy implementing this feature, not only will default Medusa modules be capable of functioning as standalone services, but developers will also be at liberty to craft their services using their preferred language or technology. Medusa will subsequently communicate effortlessly with these custom services.\n\nYou can learn more about [Modules in our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/modules/overview).

To get started building, follow the installation guide [here](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/multiwarehouse/install-modules).\n\nWith the release of the Inventory and Stock Location modules for Medusa, we provide a lightweight default option for multi-warehousing, as well as powerful customization options for bespoke integrations or solutions.\n\n## Try it out\n\nWe’ve implemented the Multi warehousing feature using the new Module architecture. This is a powerful new pattern we are introducing to enable Medusa modules to be used within existing systems or hosted in isolated environments. An additional benefit of the modularized architecture is that Medusa core only depends on an interface. This allows you to replace Medusa’s inventory module with an IMS system of your choice. All you have to do is adhere to our `IInventoryService` interface.\n\n### Integrate with the systems you know\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover;\" poster=\"/images/fulfillment-video-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/fulfillment.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\nWe are introducing multi-warehouse functionality in Medusa, complete with extensive support for fulfilling orders from various locations, including the ability to split orders across stock locations. Furthermore, Medusa's sophisticated return, exchange, and claim processes are fully prepared for multi-warehouse operations, guaranteeing optimal order routing. As always, you have access to an extensive array of events to subscribe to, enabling the automation of your workflows.\n\n## Flexible fulfillment options\n\nInitially, we are launching the inventory module featuring a 1:1 mapping between variants and inventory items. Soon, we will introduce support for variants comprising multiple inventory items, such as those consisting of several components (e.g., a tabletop and legs).\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover;\" poster=\"/images/manage-inventory-video-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/manage-inventory.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\nInventory is managed together with an inventory item’s variant information.\n\n### Managing inventory items\n\nUse the overview to adjust stocked quantities or go to variants to manage inventory further.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover;\" poster=\"/images/inventory-video-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/inventory.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\nIn the **Inventory** section, you'll obtain a comprehensive overview of your inventory items within a specific warehouse, providing you with a clear understanding of your real-time stock.\n\n### Managing inventory\n\nYou can designate a location for Sales Channels, enabling its inventory to be readily accessible for carts and orders linked to the respective channel.\n\nLocations are managed from the new sidebar item **Inventory** in a dedicated **Locations** tab.\n\n## Managing Locations and Sales Channels\n\nThese entities seamlessly integrate with Medusa's existing data model and effortlessly connect with the current workflows around sales channels, carts, orders, fulfillments and returns.\n\nReservations can be used to allocate stock at an inventory level. This will initially be used to reduce inventory availability when orders are placed. But other opportunities like reserve-online-try-in-store can also be accomplished using Reservations.\n\n### Reservations\n\nInventory Levels hold stock information for an inventory item at a specific location.\n\n### Inventory Item Levels\n\nInventory Items represent your stock-kept items.\n\n### Inventory Items\n\nUse Stock Locations to register information about each location where you store inventory.\n\n### Stock Locations\n\nThe Inventory and Stock Location modules come with the following new building blocks:\n\nMedusa delivers versatile commerce primitives and tools designed to adapt seamlessly as your requirements evolve. Our new inventory management features follow suit, offering a clear pathway for integration with third-party tools, customization with your unique business logic, and exceptional portability to craft distinct commerce experiences.\n\n## New primitives to manage inventory\n\nAs commerce businesses expand, they inevitably encounter the need to maintain inventory across multiple locations, such as global distribution centers or brick-and-mortar stores. Medusa now offers a comprehensive, ready-to-use solution for effectively managing inventory across various locations and streamlining order fulfillment processes.\n\nWe are excited to announce the release of two new modules built with the new Module SDK: [Inventory](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/multiwarehouse/inventory-module) and [Stock Locations](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/multiwarehouse/stock-location-module). Together, these modules unlock powerful Multi-Warehouse management capabilities for Medusa.\n\nYou can learn more about the Multi-Warehouse functionality in [our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/multiwarehouse/overview).\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/announcing-openapi-spec-codegen-tool.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/announcing-openapi-spec-codegen-tool.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/announcing-openapi-spec-codegen-tool.md"},"title":"Announcing OpenAPI Spec Codegen Tool","date":"2023-04-04","excerpt":"We are excited to unveil an experimental release of our forthcoming tooling for OpenAPI Specification (OAS).","darkTheme":true,"type":"PostLayout","bottomSections":[{"type":"RecentPostsSection","variant":"variant-b","colors":"colors-a","title":"Want to know more about Medusa","subtitle":"Find related blog posts below","recentCount":6,"showExcerpt":true,"showImage":false,"styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"wide","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-12","pb-20","sm:pb-56","pr-4","pl-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"center"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"center","color":"grey-40"},"actions":{"justifyContent":"center"}}}],"featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/openapi-spec-codegen-tool.jpg","altText":"Announcing OpenAPI Spec Codegen Tool","caption":"Caption of the image","objectFit":"cover","elementId":"","height":0,"width":0},"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-hchl4mxus.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-hchl4mxus.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-hchl4mxus.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Picher","username":"lorem-ipsum","email":"lorem-ipsum","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/IMG_1108.jpg","altText":"Patrick Picher"}}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json"},"name":"Product","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"We are excited to unveil an experimental release of our forthcoming tooling for OpenAPI Specification (OAS).\n\n[Medusa](https://medusajs.com/) offers modular, adaptable, and user-friendly solutions to streamline digital commerce application development and create rich, unique customer experiences.\n\nWith Medusa, you can incrementally adopt commerce modules into your stack, extend core behavior or build entirely new functionalities to achieve your goals. With our new OAS and generative tools, you can effortlessly bundle OAS files, generate SDKs, and automate documentation specific to your Medusa setup’s distinct configuration and customizations.\n\nThis article explains how to use our new OAS tool in your Medusa backend to generate OAS files and TypeScript client types.\n\n## Writing OAS in a codebase\n\nThe OpenAPI spec is a standardized way of documenting APIs. All Medusa’s REST endpoints are decorated using the [swagger-inline](https://github.com/readmeio/swagger-inline#standard-usage) library to document their behavior. These decorations allow us to generate OAS files, which we use to build our [Admin API](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin) and [Store API](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store) reference documentation.\n\nYou can find examples of how our endpoints and data models are decorated in our codebase here.\n\n*   [base OAS file](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/blob/v1.8.0-rc.0/packages/medusa/oas/store.oas.base.yaml)\n*   [path definition](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/blob/v1.8.0-rc.0/packages/medusa/src/api/routes/store/regions/list-regions.ts#L10-L99)\n*   [schema definition](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/blob/v1.8.0-rc.0/packages/medusa/src/api/routes/store/regions/list-regions.ts)\n\nWith the new improvements, we enable you to leverage the same techniques to generate OAS for your Medusa customization and configuration. Additionally, we have made it possible to automate the generation of our Client SDKs to ensure consistency in all our tools.\n\n## Generating an OAS file\n\nTo generate an OAS file for your Medusa project, install the `medusa-oas` CLI as a dev dependency in your Medusa backend:\n\n```bash\nyarn add --dev medusa-oas-cli\n```\n\nThen, generate an OAS file for the Medusa Store API:\n\n```bash\nyarn medusa-oas oas --type store --out-dir ./build/oas\n```\n\nYou can also combine your swagger-inline OAS from your server source code with Medusa Store API OAS:\n\n```bash\nyarn medusa-oas oas --type store --out-dir ./build/oas --paths ./src\n```\n\nYou can also customize other OAS sections that are not paths or schemas:\n\n```bash\nyarn medusa-oas oas --type store --out-dir ./build/oas --paths ./src --base ./src/oas/store.base.yaml\n```\n\n## Generate TypeScript client types\n\nWith comprehensive documentation of our APIs, we have also enabled generation of TypeScript client types to reduce runtime errors and improve consistency and developer experience. We generate all core Medusa types and release them through `@medusajs/client-types` for use in storefront implementations and custom applications. If you decorate your customizations, you can also leverage our new CLI to generate client types specific to your customizations.\n\nStart by generating an OAS file for both the Admin API and the Store API:\n\n```bash\nyarn medusa-oas oas --type combined --out-dir ./build/oas\n```\n\nThen, generate client types:\n\n```bash\nyarn medusa-oas client --component types --src-file ./build/oas/combined.oas.json --out-dir ./types\n```\n\n## Future iterations\n\nThe current release of Medusa’s OAS tooling is experimental, and there may be changes in the CLI’s API. Here are some items we are exploring in future iterations:\n\n### Introduce `medusa-oas docs` command\n\nWe plan to allow developers to generate rich API reference documentation similar to Medusa’s core documentation. Until then, we recommend using [SwaggerEditor](https://editor-next.swagger.io/) for viewing the generated OAS.\n\n### Generate JS and React SDKs\n\nWe wish to deprecate our current JS and React client SDKs and replace them with fully generated equivalents. This would further allow developers to generate their own custom SDKs that match their server.\n\n## Summary\n\nWe hope that by sharing our new OAS tooling early, we will be able to gather feedback from our community to better align our roadmap with what matter the most.

This update is another significant milestone in our mission to provide developers with modular building blocks that empower them to build rich, efficient, and customizable digital commerce applications without having to reinvent core commerce functionality.\n\n## Simplified and Focused Interface\n\nThe new payment processor plugin interface has been deliberately designed with a reduced scope compared to its predecessor. This ensures that integrating new payment providers is now easier than ever, providing a simple yet powerful primitive in Medusa to capture and process payments seamlessly.\n\n## Improved Adaptability and Customization\n\nBy addressing some of the limitations of the previous interface, which sometimes led to hacky implementations and difficult-to-debug issues, the new interface allows for better adaptability and customization. This flexibility aligns with Medusa's long-term vision of enabling developers to create bespoke digital commerce experiences efficiently.\n\n## Effortless Payment Processing with the PaymentProviderService\n\nThe `PaymentProviderService` abstracts obtaining payments through different providers by following a few simple steps. This service is used for authorizing payments for carts, obtaining additional payments on orders through payment collections, and can also be used for custom flows where payment authorization is necessary.\n\n## Compatibility with Leading Payment Providers\n\nOur new interface is compatible with leading payment providers, including Stripe, PayPal, Klarna, Adyen, and more, further broadening the range of possibilities for your commerce application.\n\n## Availability and Documentation\n\nThe new payment processor plugin interface is available starting with version 1.8. To learn more about the new interface and how to build plugins that implement it, please refer to [our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/carts-and-checkout/backend/add-payment-provider).\n\n## Embracing the Future of Digital Commerce\n\nWe are excited to see the unique experiences and plugins that developers will create using the simplified payment processor plugin interface v1.8. Try it out now by upgrading to the latest version of Medusa:\n\n```bash\nyarn add @medusajs/medusa@latest\n```\n\nOr start a new project:\n\n```bash\nyarn create medusa-app\n```\n\nJoin us as we continue to innovate and empower developers to build the future of digital commerce.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/announcing-product-categories.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/announcing-product-categories.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/announcing-product-categories.md"},"title":"Announcing Product Categories","date":"2023-04-04","excerpt":"We're thrilled to announce one of the most requested features from the Medusa community - Product Categories!","darkTheme":true,"type":"PostLayout","bottomSections":[{"type":"RecentPostsSection","variant":"variant-b","colors":"colors-a","title":"Want to know more about Medusa","subtitle":"Find related blog posts below","recentCount":6,"showExcerpt":true,"showImage":false,"styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"wide","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-12","pb-20","sm:pb-56","pr-4","pl-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"center"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"center","color":"grey-40"},"actions":{"justifyContent":"center"}}}],"featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/product-categories.jpg","altText":"Announcing Product Categories","caption":"Caption of the image","objectFit":"cover","elementId":"","height":0,"width":0},"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-m2422br48.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-m2422br48.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-m2422br48.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Riqwan","lastName":"Thamir","username":"lorem-ipsum","email":"lorem-ipsum","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/5105988.png","altText":"Riqwan Thamir"}}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json"},"name":"Product","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"We're thrilled to announce one of the most requested features from the Medusa community - Product Categories! With this new addition to our Product module, you can create, nest, and rank categories and add products to multiple categories.\n\nOur mission is to provide developers with the necessary tools to build rich commerce applications. To build these rich experiences, we need customer facing commerce APIs to be fast, so we’ve optimized Product Categories to deliver on that front. We've also taken the burden of managing complex tree structures that is needed to accomplish this off your hands, and instead provided a simple API for you to work with. This means you can focus on what really matters - creating wonderful experiences for your customers.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover;\" poster=\"/images/product-categories-video-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/product-categories.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\n## Efficient Category Tree Structures\n\nDealing with tree structures in relational databases is complex. Stores often limit the depth of a menu or category tree because of the performance issues that can stem from having deep tree structures. We didn’t want to enforce nesting limits and focused on building a performant schema that could overcome the limitations of other categorization engines.\n\nWe evaluated quite a few different methods on building nested tree structures, built out our criteria, evaluated tradeoffs, circumvented and managed these tradeoffs and concluded with one - Materialized Path. We could write a whole article on this process, but thats for another day.\n\nWhat we decided to prioritize were these scenarios:\n\n*   How quickly can we build an entire tree / sub-tree of categories?\n*   How quickly can we query products by category?\n*   How quickly can we query products by a category tree or group of category trees?\n\nWe were able to pass these scenarios with great results! We setup an environment with 100 categories that were nested to a depth of 5. With the help of [k6.io](http://k6.io) performance toolkit, we bombarded our server with 400+ requests over 20 second stretches and benchmarked the results. These are the benchmarks for the category API that returns the entire tree of 100 records without caching:\n\n```\navg=238ms\nmin=130ms\nmed=238ms\nmax=295ms\np(90)=245ms\np(95)=248ms\n```\n\n![](/images/HmgtmNHZAM.png)\n\n## Simple \u0026 Performant Tree APIs\n\nAfter implementing Materialized Path method to model Product Categories, our focus shifted towards designing performant  APIs to output this data.\n\n### Categories\n\nAs tree structures, categories differ slightly from regular relational APIs, and this must be considered when building category-related experiences to optimize API queries. Be prepared to dust off your recursive programming skills, because you'll be needing that a bit.\n\nHere are ways you can query the API:\n\n*   ```\n    GET /store/product-categories?parent_category_id=null\u0026include_descendants_tree=true\n    ```\n\n*   ```\n    GET /store/product-categories\n    ```\n\n*   ```\n    GET /store/product-categories?q=jeans\n    ```\n\n*   ```\n    GET /store/product-categories/pcat_testid\n    ```\n\nWhen querying the retrieve endpoint for product categories, the descendants are always returned. However, for the list endpoint, you must pass in `include_descendants_tree` to explicitly retrieve all descendants of each category. Keep in mind that this operation incurs a cost, as for every record in the collection, we perform an additional query to fetch its descendants. Therefore, it is a good idea to limit the scope to avoid calling it on a potentially large list.\n\n### Products\n\nTo query products by category, pass category IDs as a parameter to the products API. We have added a pivot table between products and categories to categorize products. When category IDs are provided, we perform a simple join to return the results. For store APIs, we limit categories to only public and active ones.\n\nLike with the categories API, you can include the `include_descendants_tree` parameter to search for not only the category you want but also its descendants. This will result in as many category queries as there are categories to fetch their descendants, but the join on products will remain singular.\n\n## Craft Bespoke Experience with Categories\n\nWith the complexities of category structures out of the way, you can focus on building rich commerce experiences that delight customers.\n\nBuilding out deep nested categories without a limit (while keeping performance) is something that most commerce platforms don’t offer. This means that you don’t have to bend to the limitations of the platform on the categorization front.  This strengthens our offering for large catalog stores, multi-brand stores, and, generally, stores that need deep and complex categorization. This also future-proofs your store's ability to handle these categorization needs as you scale.\n\nWell-designed category structures can also help customers quickly find the products they're looking for. Categories are another layer of data for upselling and recommendation strategies.\n\nYou can unleash your creativity and design unique experiences around categories that set you apart from your competitors or help you achieve your business objectives. We’re excited to see what you build with it.\n\nYou can learn more about [Product Categories in our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/products/categories).\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/announcing-transaction-orchestrator.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/announcing-transaction-orchestrator.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/announcing-transaction-orchestrator.md"},"title":"Announcing Transaction Orchestrator","date":"2023-04-04","excerpt":"Medusa is introducing a powerful new feature called Transaction Orchestrator.","darkTheme":true,"type":"PostLayout","bottomSections":[{"type":"RecentPostsSection","variant":"variant-b","colors":"colors-a","title":"Want to know more about Medusa","subtitle":"Find related blog posts below","recentCount":6,"showExcerpt":true,"showImage":false,"styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"wide","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-12","pb-20","sm:pb-56","pr-4","pl-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"center"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"center","color":"grey-40"},"actions":{"justifyContent":"center"}}}],"featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/transaction-orchestrator.jpg","altText":"Announcing Transaction Orchestrator","caption":"Caption of the image","objectFit":"cover","elementId":"","height":0,"width":0},"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-yz371kn2y.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-yz371kn2y.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-yz371kn2y.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Rodrigues","username":"lorem-ipsum","email":"lorem-ipsum","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/37986729.jpeg","altText":"Carlos Rodrigues"}}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json"},"name":"Product","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"Medusa is introducing a powerful new feature called **Transaction Orchestrator** (TO).\n\nIn a monolithic application with a single data source, managing transactions is an easy task using standard SQL transactions. However, Medusa is evolving its architecture to be more modular, allowing individual modules to run in isolation, potentially with their own data sources or even on separate servers.\n\nThis change in architecture brings new challenges for handling transactions, as one system can no longer control another's commit or rollback actions. That's where the Transaction Orchestrator (TO) steps in, offering an effective way to manage transactions within this increasingly complex environment.\n\nDesigned to enhance the control and management of transactions and workflows across multiple services or modules, the TO simplifies creating and executing distributed transactions. This allows developers to concentrate on feature implementation rather than dealing with the intricacies of managing complex distributed transactions. At Medusa, we build tools for developers to create rich commerce applications that scale, and adapting to these new challenges is a part of that mission.\n\n## The Need for Improved Transaction and Workflow Management\n\nThe TO supervises transaction flows and guarantees that successful transactions are executed fully or entirely rolled back in case of failure. With clearly defined steps for Invoke and Compensate actions, the TO follows the separation of concerns principle, allowing developers improved control over transactions and workflows.\n\nDistributed transactions are necessary for scenarios where a given workflow involves different modules for several reasons:\n\n1.  **Data consistency:** In a distributed system, maintaining data consistency across different databases becomes challenging. A TO ensures that if any part of the transaction fails, all the previous steps are rolled back (compensated), keeping the data consistent across all involved databases.\n2.  **Coordination:** Acting as a coordinator between different modules and their respective servers, the TO manages the order of execution and communication between modules, ensuring that each transaction step is executed correctly and at the right time.\n3.  **Simplifying complex workflows:** In a distributed environment, transactions can become complex due to the need to coordinate between different services and databases. A TO simplifies this process by abstracting away the complexities of managing distributed transactions, allowing developers to focus on implementing the business logic.\n4.  **Scalability:** As a system grows, managing transactions across multiple services becomes increasingly difficult. A TO helps with scalability by providing a robust framework for managing distributed transactions, making it easier to maintain and expand the system.\n\nIn the context of digital commerce, this is an important addition to Medusa’s toolbox for the following reasons:\n\n*   **Composable architectures:** A transaction orchestrator supports composable architectures, allowing developers to easily combine and reuse modules as needed. This enables the creation of highly customizable commerce applications, tailored to specific business requirements.\n*   **Adoption in legacy systems:** The TO can also facilitate the gradual transition of legacy systems to more modern, distributed architectures. This makes it easier for businesses to adopt and integrate new technologies without having to rebuild their entire infrastructure from scratch.\n*   **Unlocking infrastructure technologies:** With a transaction orchestrator, developers can leverage advanced infrastructure technologies, such as serverless and edge computing. This can lead to improved performance, reduced latency, and increased reliability for commerce applications, resulting in better user experiences and higher customer satisfaction.\n\nHere's an example of how a transaction orchestrator would help in a distributed system involving three modules:\n\n```\nModule A creates an order (Server 1, Database 1)\nModule B manages inventory (Server 2, Database 2)\nModule C handles payments (Server 3, Database 3)\n\nA typical transaction flow would be:\n\n1. Create order in Module A\n2. Deduct inventory in Module B\n3. Process payment in Module C\n```\n\nWith a TO, you can define the steps in the transaction and specify compensation actions for each step. If any step fails, the orchestrator will automatically execute the corresponding compensation actions to revert previous steps, ensuring data consistency across services.\n\nIn this example, if the payment processing in Module C fails, the TO would trigger compensation actions to add back the deducted inventory in Module B and remove the created order in Module A, preventing data inconsistency.\n\n## Achieving Cleaner Code with the Transaction Orchestrator\n\nUtilizing a transaction orchestrator results in cleaner code and single-responsibility functions compared to manually managing distributed transactions. This is due to several factors:\n\n1.  **Abstraction:** A TO abstracts the complexity of managing distributed transactions by providing a standardized framework for defining transaction steps, their corresponding compensation actions, and the flow of execution. This allows developers to focus on implementing the core business logic of each step rather than managing the complexities of distributed transactions.\n2.  **Separation of concerns:** By clearly delineating the responsibilities of each function, the TO enforces the separation of concerns. Each function is responsible for either the \"Invoke\" (execution) or \"Compensate\" (rollback) action, ensuring they perform a single, specific task. This makes the code more readable, maintainable, and testable.\n3.  **Modularity:** By using a TO, the code becomes more modular as each step in the transaction is encapsulated within its own function. This allows developers to easily modify, add, or remove transaction steps without affecting the overall structure of the transaction.\n4.  **Error Handling:** When handling distributed transactions manually, the code can become convoluted due to intricate error handling logic. The TO simplifies this by automatically managing errors and retries, allowing developers to create cleaner code without the need to address error handling for each step.\n5.  **Reusability:** The TO allows you to define reusable functions for both the \"Invoke\" and \"Compensate\" actions, which can be easily reused across different transaction scenarios. This reduces code duplication and ensures that changes to a specific action only need to be made in one place.\n\nHere is an example used in the [Multi-Warehouse Project](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/multiwarehouse/overview) that coordinates the flow to create a product variant, creating an inventory item and finally linking both together.\n\nHere is definition of the flow:\n\n```ts\nconst createVariantFlow: TransactionStepsDefinition = {\n    next: {\n        action: \"createVariantStep\",\n        saveResponse: true,\n        next: {\n            action: \"createInventoryItemStep\",\n            saveResponse: true,\n            next: {\n                action: \"attachInventoryItemStep\",\n                noCompensation: true,\n            },\n        },\n    },\n}\n```\n\nThe actions are handled by a single function called by the TO respecting the Transaction Definition above.\nNote that the implementation of each function was omitted to keep the example short; however, their names are self-explanatory.\n\n```ts\nasync function transactionHandler(\n    actionId: string,\n    type: TransactionHandlerType,\n    payload: TransactionPayload\n) {\n    const command = {\n        createVariantStep: {\n            invoke: async (data: CreateProductVariantInput) =\u003e {\n                return await createProductVariant(data) // omitted\n            },\n            compensate: async (data: CreateProductVariantInput, { invoke }) =\u003e {\n                await removeProductVariant(invoke.createVariantStep) // omitted\n            },\n        },\n        createInventoryItemStep: {\n            invoke: async (data: CreateProductVariantInput, { invoke }) =\u003e {\n                return await createInventoryItem(invoke.createVariantStep) // omitted\n            },\n            compensate: async (data: CreateProductVariantInput, { invoke }) =\u003e {\n                await removeInventoryItem(invoke.createInventoryItemStep) // omitted\n            },\n        },\n        attachInventoryItemStep: {\n            invoke: async (data: CreateProductVariantInput, { invoke }) =\u003e {\n                return await attachInventoryItem( // omitted\n                    invoke.createVariantStep,\n                    invoke.createInventoryItemStep\n                )\n            },\n        },\n    }\n\n    return command[actionId][type](payload.data, payload.context)\n}\n\n```\n\nFinally, the TO is instantiated and a new transaction initialized.\n\n```ts\nconst strategy = new TransactionOrchestrator(\n    \"create-variant-with-inventory\", // transaction name\n    createVariantFlow // transaction steps definition\n)\n\nconst transaction = await strategy.beginTransaction(\n    ulid(), // unique id\n    transactionHandler, // handler\n    createProductVariantInput // input\n)\nawait strategy.resume(transaction)\n```\n\nHere is an animated diagram of the transaction described above:\n\n![](/images/TO.gif)\n\nThis marks just the beginning of Transaction Orchestration in Medusa. In the near future, we'll introduce numerous other flows that function similarly, enabling you to customize and expand existing workflows with your unique steps.\n\n## Handling Complex Workflows with the Transaction Orchestrator\n\nThe Transaction Orchestrator enables developers to create complex workflows for synchronous and long-running tasks that may take a while to receive a response (asynchronous). These workflows can be organized in a way that may not necessarily be transactional but can still be effectively orchestrated.\n\nThere are several scenarios where asynchronous workflows with long-running steps can be applied using the TO:\n\n1.  **E-commerce order fulfillment:** In an e-commerce system, a workflow might involve creating an order, reserving inventory, charging the customer, generating shipping labels, and updating the shipping status. Some of these steps, such as generating shipping labels or charging the customer, could take a considerable amount of time due to external dependencies like payment gateways and shipping services.\n2.  **Fraud detection and prevention:** In an e-commerce system, fraud detection and prevention workflows might involve analyzing customer data, order patterns, and payment information to identify potential fraudulent activities. These workflows may include time-consuming tasks like querying external fraud detection APIs or applying machine learning models to analyze data.\n3.  **Returns and refunds processing:** In an e-commerce returns and refunds workflow, several steps may involve long-running tasks, such as receiving returned products, inspecting their condition, updating inventory, and processing refunds. Some of these steps may take a considerable amount of time, especially when dealing with external payment gateways or waiting for products to be returned and inspected.\n\nIn all these examples, workflows are valuable for handling intricate, multi-step processes that include tasks taking considerable time or involving external dependencies without immediate responses. By leveraging the Transaction Orchestrator, developers can proficiently manage these workflows, ensuring proper execution order and handling errors and compensations as needed.\n\n## What’s Next\n\nThe Transaction Orchestrator in Medusa enhances control over transactions and workflows in complex, multi-service scenarios. As Medusa's architecture becomes more modular, many flows will be refactored to leverage the Orchestrator. This allows developers to focus on business logic while the Orchestrator handles consistency and infrastructure concerns. In the future, support for asynchronous tasks will be added, enabling the handling of long-running tasks or non-REST API approaches, making Medusa even more adaptable and developer-friendly.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/best-practices-for-ecommerce-checkout-design.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/best-practices-for-ecommerce-checkout-design.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/best-practices-for-ecommerce-checkout-design.md"},"title":"Best Practices for Ecommerce Checkout Design for your Business","date":"2023-03-21","excerpt":"Optimize your checkout process and increase your business's online sales with this guide of best practices for ecommerce checkout design","darkTheme":true,"type":"PostLayout","bottomSections":[{"type":"RecentPostsSection","variant":"variant-b","colors":"colors-a","title":"Want to know more about Medusa","subtitle":"Find related blog posts below","recentCount":6,"showExcerpt":true,"showImage":false,"styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"wide","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-12","pb-20","sm:pb-56","pr-4","pl-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"center"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"center","color":"grey-40"},"actions":{"justifyContent":"center"}}}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-8so6wxsv1.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-8so6wxsv1.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-8so6wxsv1.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Safa","lastName":"Emhemed","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/IMG_20220302_093550 (1).jpg","altText":"Safa Emhemed"}}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-29bs7fo47.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json"},"type":"Category","name":"Community"},"featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/checkout-fundamentals.jpg","altText":"Best Practices for Ecommerce Checkout Design for your Business","caption":"Caption of the image","objectFit":"cover","elementId":""},"markdown_content":"Optimizing your ecommerce checkout process is crucial to reduce cart abandonment rates, as it affects customer satisfaction and the likelihood of returns. If the checkout process is not smooth and simple, the customers may [abandon their carts](https://medusajs.com/blog/ecommerce-cart-functionality/) without making a purchase and may not return to your ecommerce.\n\nThis article shares the best practices for optimizing your checkout process and boosting your sales.\n\n*What is Medusa?* [*Medusa*](https://medusajs.com/) *is a set of open source commerce modules that gives developers and businesses the flexibility to build sophisticated and unique digital experiences. One of Medusa’s building blocks include a *[*Next.js storefront*](https://docs.medusajs.com/starters/nextjs-medusa-starter)* that implements all the checkout best practices mentioned in this article.*\n\n## 10 Ecommerce Checkout Best Practices\n\n### Don’t Force Customers to Create an Account\n\nForcing customers to register means you are creating an obstacle for customers who want to buy, ultimately increasing abandoning carts. Therefore, offering a guest checkout option helps you to increase the chances of a sale.\n\nAllow guests to checkout and complete their purchases with an email address to make the checkout experience more effortless.\n\nIn addition, you can allow customers to log in using their social media accounts, including Facebook or Google, to simplify the checkout process and eliminate the need for registering and entering personal information.\n\nAlternatively, let the customer have the option to create an account by adding a checkbox that prompts them to choose whether they want to create an account. When customers select this option, a password field should appear, allowing customers to set a password. This way, the customer must only fill in an extra field for the password.\n\n**Don't**\n\n*   Force customers to create accounts to fill their carts or to complete the checkout process.\n\n**Do**\n\n*   Allow customers to checkout as guests.\n*   Make creating an account simple by enabling social login and by one-click creating an account.\n\n### Ask Only for Necessary Information and Enable Auto Fill\n\nAvoid annoying the customer with extra steps and information, as this may make their shopping experience time-consuming and uncomfortable.\n\nTo ease the checkout process, keep the forms concise by requesting only essential information about the customer. Eliminate any unnecessary steps and clearly describe why certain information is required. For example, avoid asking for non-essential details, including Address 2, birthday, gender, or company name. Add a single field for the full name instead of separate fields for first and last name.\n\n![](/images/7nRhTYuYHH.gif)\n\n*Clarify why this field required on* [*Amazon*](https://www.amazon.com/)\n\nIn addition, make sure to enable Autocomplete Attribute for input elements. This helps speed the process up by making billing and shipping addresses auto-fill as soon as the customer starts typing. Most browsers like Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari support this feature.\n\nFurthermore, offer a checkbox to enable customers to use the billing address as the shipping address, simplifying the form-filling process and making it more efficient. You can automatically populate the form with email, shipping, and billing address information if the customer is logged in. However, allow customers to change this information if needed to streamline the process.\n\n![](/images/PzHeKEqUVG.gif)\n\n*Checkout on* [*Palmes*](https://medusajs.com/blog/palmes-use-case/)\n\n**Don’t**\n\n*   Ask for unnecessary information, including age, gender, company name, and more.\n*   Make the form too long to fill.\n\n**Do**\n\n*   Enable auto-fill for all checkout form input fields.\n*   Let the user use the same address for shipping and billing. If the customer logs in, fill in the payment and address information form account information.\n\n### Offer Multiple Payment Methods\n\nSupport multiple [payment](https://medusajs.com/blog/stripe-ecommerce/) options when purchasing online, especially for ecommerce that supports global shipping. This ensures a seamless payment experience for the customer.\n\nProvide a variety of payment methods that customers in different locations can use, and set the most popular methods first. That allows customers to pay with the preferred payment method that suits them and helps you to increase your credibility.\n\nMost customers prefer to use common credit or debit cards from Visa or Mastercard, but many alternatives have emerged in the last few years. You should consider including payment options such as Apple Pay and Google Pay.\n\n**Don’t:**\n\n*   Limit payment options on your ecommerce.\n*   Use uncommon payment methods that confuse the customer.\n\n**Do:**\n\n*   Provide a variety of payment methods.\n*   Consider Mobile payments and e-bank transfers, not only cards.\n\n![](/images/8zW_MJ7mjR.png)\n\n*Payment Method on* [*Tekla*](https://medusajs.com/blog/case-study-tekla-medusa/)\n\n### Use Descriptive Form Labels\n\nForm Labels are an essential part of accessibility. Good labeling can guide the customers to add the correct information.\n\nKeep labels short and descriptive, telling the customer what the input fields mean and that the form is easy to read and scan. For example, instead of using “Where do you live?” or “Where would you like to receive the package?” use the label “Address”. Customers will recognize what information they should add.\n\nDon't use the placeholder as a label because the placeholder disappears when the customer starts typing. Still, the label or the floating placeholder remains visible after the field has been filled in. That helps customers remember what exactly the purpose of the field is.\n\nYou can use the placeholder with the label as a description or example of the required information for the field.\n\n![](/images/QJXfJJUIoQ.png)\n\n*Pincode placeholder on* [*Amazon India*](https://www.amazon.in/)\n\nPlace the label above an input field so the customer is not forced to look separately at the label and the input field, which results in a quick and easy completion time. Make the label font clear and bold.\n\n![](/images/XgWkSODOVU.png)\n\n*Checkout Form on* [*Tekla*](https://medusajs.com/blog/case-study-tekla-medusa/)\n\n**Don't:**\n\n*   Use long-form labels.\n*   Use a placeholder as a label.\n\n**Do:**\n\n*   Use the placeholder as a description for the input information.\n*   Place the label above of input fields.\n\n### Highlight Required Fields and Use Clear Validation Messages\n\nForm validation ensures the customer’s data entered into a form meets the requirements and serves as a communication point during checkout.\n\nTo save your customer time and prevent errors, highlight the required fields and provide clear instructions on what they need to pay attention to while completing the process. If a customer enters incorrect information in a field, provide concise and informative validation messages to guide them on fixing the error and moving forward quickly in the checkout process.\n\nPlace the validation message near the field with the error to draw the customers' attention and avoid the need to search for the field.\n\nIt’s also important to notify customers of any invalid or missing input fields in real time before proceeding to the checkout process's next step. This way, customers can address any issues without retracing previous steps later.\n\n![](/images/ZcWLCvopDb.gif)\n\n*Checkout Form on* [*Tekla*](https://medusajs.com/blog/case-study-tekla-medusa/)\n\n**Don’t:**\n\n*   Add broad messages such as “there’s something wrong” when there is an error or invalid data.\n*   Use long validation messages.\n\n**Do:**\n\n*   Highlight the required fields.\n*   Make validation messages specific, concise, and informative. And use field validation in real time.\n\n### **Make The Checkout Page Mobile Friendly**\n\nWith the growing number of people using [mobile phones](https://medusajs.com/blog/why-headless-commerce-is-the-perfect-solution-for-omnichannel-support/) for online purchases, it’s essential to create a seamless mobile experience and optimize your checkout process for the success of your ecommerce business.\n\nOn smaller devices, use wide checkout buttons and large fonts to minimize this risk and help customers to complete a purchase smoothly without any obstacles. Also, avoid placing two or more fields in a single row. Instead, use individual rows with labels for each field; this ensures a smooth sequential transition through the checkout process.\n\n![](/images/tywqLtj00p.gif)\n\n*Checkout Form on* [*Tekla*](https://medusajs.com/blog/case-study-tekla-medusa/)\n\n**Don’t:**\n\n*   Place more than one field in a row.\n*   Keep the buttons and fields small.\n\n**Do:**\n\n*   Make the form fields vertical and use wide buttons on small devices.\n*   Put one field in a single row, a maximum of two fields for short inputs.\n\n### Highlight Security and Privacy\n\nThe more secure your ecommerce is, the more trust and credibility you establish with your customers. They can confidently purchase through your ecommerce with their sensitive payment information, billing, shipping, and personal information.\n\nShow the payment methods with the original payment gateways logo, such as Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal, to offer customers a transparent and secure experience.\n\nTo further earn customer trust, display security certifications or trust seals like Norton and Better Business Bureau at the checkout screen, showcasing your ecommerce protection. Adding Extended Validation Certificate (EV) can help your customers to comprehend your ecommerce verification and display a green assurance bar with your ecommerce name.\n\nHaving an SSL certificate with HTTPS also reassures customers and motivates them to move forward in the checkout process.\n\n**Don’t:**\n\n*   Let the checkout process without security options.\n\n**Do:**\n\n*   Use original payment gateway logos, including Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal.\n*   Use certifications or trust seals like Norton and Better Business Bureau.\n*   Add SSL certificate with HTTPS.\n\n### **Show Checkout Progress Bar**\n\nWhen customers don’t know how long the checkout process will take, they might abandon their checkout process. Prevent this by adding a progress indicator that allows them to track their progress and know where they are in the checkout process. It guides and shows the customer what to do during the checkout process.\n\nMake the progress indicators with the fewest steps to show the customers how quick checkout will be. The design should be clear, with each status indicated by a different color.\n\nAdd a descriptive label for each step instead of just displaying a number. For example, Step 1-Personal Details, Step 2- Shipping Details, and Step 3- Payment Details. This informs customers what they need to complete the purchase.\n\nOffer customers a back option if they need to edit their address or make any other changes. Also, always save the progress if the customer wants to exit and return later.\n\n![](/images/fOB375jw_T.gif)\n\n*Checkout Indicator on* [*Tekla*](https://medusajs.com/blog/case-study-tekla-medusa/)\n\n**Don’t:**\n\n*   Make the process too long.\n*   Reset the information in case the customer is back.\n\n**Do:**\n\n*   Make the indicators in as few steps as possible.\n*   Make the steps clear visually and add a descriptive label for each step.\n\n### **Improve Website Performance**\n\nImproving site performance is important for any ecommerce website. Poor performance, including crashes and slow loading times, can lead customers to abandon the checkout process. Therefore, good performance can encourage the customer to complete the process and lead to increase conversions and sales.\n\nMake sure to use a hosting service that fits your ecommerce and customer traffic. Avoid shared hosting and opt for VPS or cloud hosting, which allows you to scale performance according to your needs.\n\nTest your ecommerce with tools like [Pagespeed](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) Insights and [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/) to evaluate your ecommerce and identify areas for improvement.\n\nWebsite speed is impacted by the number of files the browser has to request to load a website, causing delays in loading time. To speed up your website, reduce the number of HTTP requests by removing unnecessary elements, features, and plugins, minifying code, compressing assets and utilizing Lazy Loading. Lazy Loading allows the browser to upload assets while customers are scrolling, sending requests only for the visible portion of the page, which speeds up the initial loading time.\n\n**Don’t:**\n\n*   Don’t send too many HTTP requests.\n\n**Do:**\n\n*   Test your website with performance testing tools to discover improvement areas.\n*   Use lazy loading.\n\n### Add Upsell and Cross-Sell\n\nUpselling and cross-selling strategies increase customer satisfaction and result in additional purchases, making them an easy win for increasing sales. Upselling involves encouraging customers to purchase higher-end or premium versions of the products that the customer selects. And coss-selling encourages customers to purchase related or complementary products to the ones selected by the customer.\nOffer product bundling to make the customer buy more products with fewer steps, and offer a special price or discount on the total amount of product bundling, making them feel like they have received a good deal. However, it’s important to only suggest relevant products based on the customer's browsing history or car content. Avoid suggesting products the customer doesn’t need, as you could lose credibility.\n\n**Don’t:**\n\n*   Offer product bundling with products not relevant to each other.\n*   Show products that customers are not interested in.\n\n**Do:**\n\n*   Offer product bundling.\n*   Offer a special price or discount for product bundling.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA well-designed checkout process is one of the most critical aspects of success in your ecommerce. This process determines whether potential customers become loyal or abandon their carts.\n\nOptimizing the checkout process covers several elements, but it mainly involves ensuring customers can complete the process quickly and easily with a few steps. It’s important to ensure that the checkout process is enjoyable for the customer, without any boredom and difficulties that could discourage them from buying.\n\nDevelopers can utilize Medusa to build a checkout experience tailored towards their users. There are no limitations in how they build it or what tech stack they use.

Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\nGreat news for Nuxt fans. [Jakub Andrzejewski](https://twitter.com/jacobandrewsky) recently created a new `nuxt-medusa` module, that simplifies the process of integrating Medusa’s commerce modules with a Nuxt application.\n\n[Access the module here](https://github.com/baroshem/nuxt-medusa), including a tutorial, documentation, video, and release notes. You can also try it directly in your browser using the [module sandbox on Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/baroshem/nuxt-medusa?file=.stackblitz%2Fnuxt.config.ts).\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EuakPz8M7CM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\u003e **What is Medusa?** [Medusa](https://medusajs.com/) provides modular and open commerce infrastructure built to make custom-development processes easier for developers. Medusa’s components and APIs are built in abstract layers, making it easy for developers to customize the core functionalities for different commerce cases.\n\n## Technical aspects\n\nThe Nuxt-Medusa module is built on top of Nuxt.js, a popular framework for building server-side rendered Vue.js applications. It is designed to work seamlessly with Medusa.\n\nThe module uses [@medusa/medusa-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@medusajs/medusa-js) under the hood to query the Medusa API and retrieve data, which is then exposed to the Nuxt.js application.\n\n## Features\n\nSetting up the Nuxt-Medusa module is a relatively [straightforward process](https://nuxt-medusa.vercel.app/getting-started/setup). The module is relatively new, but it includes short and concise documentation that provides step-by-step guidance on configuring and using its two available features.\n\n*   [**useMedusaClient**](https://nuxt-medusa.vercel.app/features/usemedusaclient) **composable**.\n*   [**serverMedusaClient**](https://nuxt-medusa.vercel.app/features/servermedusaclient#servermedusaclient) **utility.**\n\nAt this moment, there aren’t more features available, but the module maintainer [opened an issue ](https://github.com/Baroshem/nuxt-medusa/issues/13)on the GitHub repository, so other users can ask for new features.\n\n## Why use it\n\n*   It simplifies the process of integrating the Medusa engine with a Nuxt.js application. This can save you significant time and effort, as they no longer need to manually configure and integrate the two frameworks.\n*   It’s the first module in the Nuxt 3 version that specifically targets digital commerce functionality. This opens the door for developers interested in building commerce applications using Nuxt.js, providing a streamlined and efficient way to integrate Medusa with their Nuxt.js applications.\n\n## How to Install the Module\n\nInstall the module in your Nuxt.js project:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev nuxt-medusa\n```\n\nThen, add `nuxt-medusa` to the `modules` section of `nuxt.config.ts`:\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  modules: ['nuxt-medusa'],\n})\n```\n\nFinally, in your `.env` file add a `MEDUSA_URL` variable with its value being the URL of the server:\n\n```\nMEDUSA_URL=\u003cYOUR_MEDUSA_URL\u003e # By default http://localhost:9000\n```\n\n## How to Use the Module\n\nYou can fetch data from Medusa in Nuxt like this:\n\n```\n\u003cscript setup lang=\"ts\"\u003e\n  const client = useMedusaClient();\n  const { products } = await client.products.list();\n\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nAnd you will get the data about your products. It’s that simple!\n\nThis approach certainly works in case of fetching products’ data on the client (browser). However, in some cases you may want to fetch this data on the server side of Nuxt (for example, to reduce network latency of customers visiting your website). You can do this with the module as well!\n\nTo fetch the data on the server side, let’s first enable this functionality by setting the `server` option in the configuration to `true`:\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  modules: ['nuxt-medusa'],\n  medusa: {\n    server: true\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThis will enable the server utility to be imported in your project and you can use it like following:\n\n```\nimport { serverMedusaClient } from '#medusa/server'\n\nexport default eventHandler(async (event) =\u003e {\n  const client = serverMedusaClient(event)\n  const { products } = await client.products.list()\n\n  return { products }\n})\n```\n\nAs you can see, the approach here is almost the same as in the client, with the only difference that we are using the event Handlers of Nuxt to handle this functionality on the server.\n\nFinally, we can call this event handler from the frontend like the following:\n\n```\n\u003cscript lang=\"ts\" setup\u003e\n  const { products } = await $fetch('/api/products')\n\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nAnd that’s it! You can now fetch the products on the server. Keep in mind that you are not limited to products only, as you can fetch basically whatever you like as you have access to the Medusa client.\n\nHappy coding!\n\n## Want to contribute to the Medusa Community?\n\nIf you are also interested in building a community plugin for Medusa and showcasing it to the broader [Medusa](https://medusajs.com/) community, do not hesitate to contact nick@medusajs.com.\n\nWe appreciate the contributions.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/nodejs-ecommerce.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/nodejs-ecommerce.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/nodejs-ecommerce.md"},"title":"Pros and Cons of using Node.js for Ecommerce","date":"2023-03-14","excerpt":"This article highlights the pros and cons of using Node.js in ecommerce.","darkTheme":true,"type":"PostLayout","authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-bsn7kbrm1.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-bsn7kbrm1.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-bsn7kbrm1.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Prince","lastName":"Onyeanuna","username":"lorem-ipsum","email":"lorem-ipsum","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/prince.jpg","altText":"Prince Onyeanuna"}}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-29bs7fo47.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json"},"type":"Category","name":"Community"},"featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/pros-cons-node-min.jpg","altText":"Pros and Cons of using Node.js for Ecommerce","caption":"Caption of the image","objectFit":"cover","elementId":""},"markdown_content":"\n\u003ccallout icon=\"exclamationCircleSolid\" button-label=\"Go to Docs\" button-url=\"http://docs.medusajs.com\"\u003e\n**Notice**\nMedusa is under active development, so the content of this post may be outdated. Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\n[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is a JavaScript runtime environment which developers use to build scalable network applications. You can use it in various software, including ecommerce platforms.\n\nTo deliver high performance and speed for ecommerce applications, Node.js is one of the best choices. It provides features like an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. It also provides an extensive ecosystem of third-party modules and packages.  With Node.js, it is much easier to build applications.\n\nThis article highlights the pros and cons of using Node.js in ecommerce. It’ll guide developers to make informed decisions about whether to use Node.js for ecommerce solutions or not.\n\n## What is Node.js?\n\n[Node.js](https://medusajs.com/blog/nodejs-ecommerce-backend/) is an open source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is built on a V8 engine and is known for its speed and performance. Node.js enables JavaScript development on the server side.\n\nThe traditional client-side JavaScript is executed within a web browser. However, Node.js runs JavaScript code outside of a web browser, allowing it to be used for server-side development.\n\nNode.js has a non-blocking I/O model; it can handle multiple requests simultaneously without blocking the execution of other code. It differs from conventional server-side technologies, which typically operate on a threaded model where individual threads manage each request.\n\nNode.js is a flexible tool used for building a vast number of projects, including the following:\n\n*   Web servers: Using Node.js as a web server guarantees speed and flexibility.\n*   Web applications: Node.js is a great choice for building real-time web applications. It is especially important for applications that require fast and scalable server-side logic.\n*   Chatbots: Creating bots that interact and respond to users' requests is possible with Node.js.\n*   Command-Line Tools: Node.js can help build command-line tools to automate repetitive tasks.\n\n![](/images/At6G8XPqol.jpg)\n\nAs seen in the image above, Node.js is the most popular web technology according to [StackOverflow](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-popular-technologies-web-frameworks-and-technologies). It's a suitable choice for ecommerce as resources and relevant information to learn and use this language are readily available.\n\n## 5 Pros of Using Node.js for Ecommerce\n\nThere are many advantages of using Node.js for ecommerce. This section outlines some of the advantages in detail.\n\n### 1. Speed and Performance\n\nOwing to the V8 engine it is built on, Node.js is known for its speed. The V8 engine compiles JavaScript code into machine code, allowing it to run faster than interpreted languages.\n\nAdditionally, Node.js can handle multiple concurrent requests due to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. Therefore, even under high-traffic conditions, Node.js can deliver quick response times, making it a viable choice for ecommerce applications.\n\n### 2. Scalability\n\nAn advantage of web applications is the ability to automatically scale up or down depending on incoming traffic. This is true for ecommerce applications that deal with growing numbers of users and transactions. It is therefore essential to utilize Node.js in building ecommerce applications.\n\nNode.js is scalable due to its single-threaded event-loop, non-blocking I/O model, and modular design. Adding more servers, distributing the workload among them, and increasing each server's resources allows the system to scale.\n\nThis means that you can add more resources to a single Node.js server to increase its capacity or you can add more servers to handle an increasing amount of traffic.\n\n### 3. Large Community\n\nNode.js has an extensive community of developers willing to provide support, resources, and tools. You can utilize these to build ecommerce applications. With a growing library of packages and modules, Node.js offers developers the resources to create efficient and reliable ecommerce applications.\n\nIt's easier to find solutions to problems and stay updated when information is more accessible and easy to learn.\n\nThe following are avenues to join various Node.js communities:\n\n*   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nodejs)\n*   [Slack](https://www.nodeslackers.com/)\n\n### 4. Modular Approach\n\nEcommerce applications handle large amounts of data, and managing this data becomes increasingly difficult over time. However, Node.js developers use a modular approach to develop these applications.\n\nNode.js supports a modular approach to development that allows you to break down code into manageable and functional blocks. It makes building, maintaining, and testing code easier.\n\n### 5. Integration with Other Technologies\n\nNode.js is compatible with various technologies. You can integrate Node.js with technologies ranging from frontend frameworks to databases and other programming languages.\n\nWith this advantage, it becomes easier to build ecommerce applications that integrate with other systems and services critical to business. Some of these services may include payment services, third-party systems, etc.\n\nNode.js offers some critical advantages for ecommerce applications. You can create robust, efficient, and scalable ecommerce applications that meet your business and customers' needs by leveraging Node.js's advantages.\n\n## 3 Cons of Using Node.js for Ecommerce\n\nWhile Node.js has a lot of pros for developing ecommerce applications, there are also some cons. When developing an application with Nodejs, developers should carefully consider the tradeoffs and prepare to address these cons. Some of them are outlined below.\n\n### 1. Limited Library Support\n\nAs of 2022, the official repo for Node.js packages (NPM) contains over 1.5 million packages, indicating that there is an extensive library of packages available for Node.js. However, not all of these packages are relevant or suitable for ecommerce applications.\n\nSome critical functionalities required for ecommerce applications may have limited support or only a few packages available. Inventory management, order processing, and payment gateway integration are essential for ecommerce applications but may have limited support in Node.js libraries.\n\nDevelopers can write code from scratch to implement these features. However, it could take a long time and restrict the number of features included in the application. Therefore, it's important to carefully evaluate the availability and quality of packages when building an ecommerce application using Node.js.\n\n### 2. Callback Hell\n\nWhen there are deeply-nested callbacks inside a function, it's referred to as \"Callback Hell\". Node.js suffers from callback hell because it heavily relies on asynchronous programming. Callbacks are the primary way to handle asynchronous operations in Node.js.\n\nMultiple asynchronous operations are nested inside one another. The code can become deeply nested and difficult to read and maintain leading to callback hell.\n\n### 3. Single-Threaded Model\n\nThe Node.js single-threaded model means that all code runs on one thread making it efficient for handling I/O tasks. However, it can create issues with functions requiring significant processing power or I/O operations that can block other tasks.\n\nNode.js runs on a single thread; hence any long-running operation can block this thread. This will prevent other requests from being processed. It can lead to slower response times and a degraded user experience.\n\nIn ecommerce applications, it is essential to have a scalable and responsive platform. This is important because it can handle a high volume of requests without causing performance issues.\n\n## 5 Best Practices for Building an Ecommerce Platform with Node.js\n\nThe following are practical tips and recommendations for building scalable and secure ecommerce platforms using Node.js.\n\n### 1. Choose a Reliable Node.js Ecommerce Engine\n\nAn ecommerce engine is a software solution that provides the core functionality for building an ecommerce application. It handles product catalogue management, order processing, payment processing, and customer management. It typically consists of APIs, data models, and user interfaces that developers can use to develop custom ecommerce applications.\n\nUsing a dependable ecommerce engine can help developers save time and energy in creating essential ecommerce features. It lets them concentrate on developing distinct capabilities and adaptations for their requirements.\n\nOne option to consider is [Medusa](https://docs.medusajs.com/usage/create-medusa-app). Medusa is a set of open source commerce building blocks that allows you to build bespoke commerce applications without using cumbersome commerce platforms. Medusa is built on Node.js and can be deployed on modern infrastructure like serverless or edge workers.\n\n### 2. Consider a Modular Approach\n\nModules are supported by Node.js. It would be best if you used modules while building ecommerce applications. In addition, modules simplify the process of debugging code in development. If one module has an error, it won't break the entire code, as each module contains its functions.\n\nModular development allows developers to work on different application parts concurrently. It improves productivity and reduces development time. It also makes it easier to maintain and update the application since you can change individual modules without affecting the rest.\n\nTo implement a modular approach, developers can use techniques such as dependency injection and module bundlers like Webpack. They can also use pre-existing libraries and frameworks that support modular design, like Nest.js and Express.js.\n\nTo implement the modular architecture, follow the steps below:\n\n1.  Identify all the application's core features, e.g. user management, cart management, order management, etc.\n2.  Break down the modules into smaller independent modules where each performs a specific task. This will make it easier to test and debug.\n3.  Define clear interfaces between modules so that when you make changes to one module, they do not affect the other.\n4.  Utilize a package manager such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/about) to manage modules and their dependencies.\n\n### 3. Integrations\n\nWhen building an ecommerce platform with Node.js, leveraging modern technologies for integrations is essential. This ensures seamless connections with other applications and services.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), which allow different systems to communicate with each other. APIs can help to integrate various services and features into the ecommerce platform. These platforms include payment gateways, shipping providers, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and more.\n\nAnother approach is to use [webhooks](https://medusajs.com/blog/medusa-webhooks-best-technical-project-of-medusa-hackathon/), which allow automatic notifications and updates to be sent from one system to another. For example, when placing an order on the ecommerce platform, a webhook can trigger an update to the shipping provider. This notifies them to fulfil the order.\n\nSome examples of popular webhooks include:\n\n1.  Stripe: Payment and subscription events\n2.  Twilio: SMS and call events\n\nBy utilizing modern integration technologies, ecommerce platforms can provide a better experience for customers.\n\n### 4. Frontend Development\n\nThe frontend of an ecommerce application is what the user interacts with directly. It includes the design, layout, and functionality of the website or web application. Utilizing modern frontend technologies can improve the user experience and increase customer engagement.\n\nOne popular modern technology for frontend development is the [Jamstack architecture](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/). Jamstack stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It is a modern web development approach that emphasizes pre-built markup, serverless functions, and client-side JavaScript. This approach helps to create fast and secure websites.\n\nIn addition to providing speed, security, and stability, Jamstack sites use static site generators. This loads quickly and are more secure than traditional server-side rendering methods. It is significant for ecommerce sites, where speed and security can impact sales and customer trust.\n\nJamstack technology enables third-party service integration, such as payment gateways or shipping providers, through webhooks and APIs.\n\nSome other popular frontend technologies for ecommerce applications include:\n\n*   [React](https://medusajs.com/blog/5-react-based-tools-for-ecommerce-stack/): A JavaScript library used to create user interfaces. It is well-known for its flexibility and ability to reuse components.\n*   Angular: A framework for building web applications known for its robustness.\n*   Vue.js: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces known for its simplicity and flexibility.\n*   [Next.js](https://medusajs.com/blog/nextjs-ecommerce-storefront-comes-packed-with-ready-integrations-to-paypal-meilisearch-stripe-and-more/): A framework for building server-side rendered React applications, known for its performance and SEO benefits.\n\nToday's ecommerce landscape requires optimizing websites for mobile devices, implementing responsive design, and utilizing the technologies mentioned earlier. It is because more and more users are shopping on their mobile devices.\n\n### 5. Implement Security Measures\n\nImplementing security measures on an ecommerce platform is crucial to protecting sensitive information. Such information includes customer data, payment information, etc. With proper security measures, your ecommerce platform can become protected from various security threats, such as hacking, phishing, and other cyberattacks.\n\nBy implementing proper security measures, you can help ensure that your ecommerce platform is secure and protected from these threats. It will help build trust with your customers and protect their sensitive information. This is crucial for the success of any ecommerce business.\n\nHere are some best practices for enhancing security:\n\n1.  Secure the Server: Configure the server correctly, and make sure all security patches are current. Implement firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems to protect against unauthorized access.\n2.  Use HTTPS: The protocol encrypts data transmissions between the server and the client. It helps protect sensitive information such as login credentials and payment information.\n3.  Implement User Login and Permission Controls: This ensures that only authorized users can access the platform. It can include strong passwords and role-based access controls.\n4.  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Injection: Implement measures to prevent these attacks, which could put customer data at risk. It can involve verifying input, using prepared statements, and encoding output.\n5.  Regularly Update Software and Plugins: Keep all software and plugins up to date with the latest security patches and updates.\n6.  Conduct Regular Security Audits and Testing: Regularly conduct security audits and tests to identify potential weaknesses and areas for improvement. It can include penetration testing, and code reviews.\n\nBy implementing these security measures, ecommerce platforms built with Node.js can better protect sensitive customer data and maintain customer trust.\n\n## Medusa and Node.js\n\nNode.js offers a versatile and efficient platform for building fast, scalable, and secure ecommerce applications. Node.js has its downsides, such as limited library support, callback hell, and difficulty with concurrent processing. However, it remains a popular choice among developers. This is due to its speed, performance, and large community.\n\nMedusa is already the leading commerce infrastructure for Node.js developers on GitHub. It provides a set of commerce modules built to make custom-development processes easier for developers. It provides core commerce functionality related to order and customer handling, product management, along with many other features such as multi-currency multi-channel support.

It hasn’t always been well-designed stores with extensive features and carefully-planned user experiences. A lot of what is fundamental and basic today was revolutionary when discovered at its time.\n\nThis article goes down the memory lane of ecommerce, uncovering some old-but-gold ecommerce websites, and highlighting the main difference from ecommerce today.\n\n## 1979: Michael Aldrich's First Attempt at Ecommerce\n\n![](/images/rot_j_ksu4.gif)\n\nIn 1979, [Michael Aldrich](https://www.aldricharchive.co.uk/) invented online shopping through televisions. This was way before the inventions of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW). He invented it by connecting a modified domestic TV to a transaction processing computer through a domestic telephone line.\n\nMichael Aldrich believed that [Videotex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotex) was a revolutionary communication medium that was universally applicable and participative, and the first of its kind since the invention of the telephone.\n\nFollowing his invention, [two businesses used Michael’s invention](https://www.aldricharchive.co.uk/internet-online-shopping): Gateshead SIS with Tesco and Bradford Centrepoint with Wm. Morrison. This allowed consumers to [open their TV and choose groceries](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24091393) from a local supermarket. The order would then be sent through the phone line to a local Tesco, where the ordered items would be packaged and sent to the consumer.\n\n## 1984: CompuServe’s Electronic Mall\n\n![](/images/JY4yU_yI-u.png)\n\n[*Image Source*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-oBJml1mL0)\n\nCompuServe was one of the first businesses getting close to an ecommerce experience. It was a popular networking service that provided users with emails, message boards, and more.\n\nIn 1984, CompuServe added a service called “Electronic Mall” that allowed users to buy items [from over 100 online retailers](https://money.howstuffworks.com/history-e-commerce.htm) through a simple CLI interface where customers could browse different vendors, product categories and even insert credit information for later purchases.\n\nYou can see a demo of it all [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-oBJml1mL0).\n\n## 1992: Book Stacks Unlimited, the Amazon Predecessor\n\n![](/images/Book%20Inc.gif)\n\n[*Image Source*](https://www.timetoast.com/timelines/el-comercio-electronico-35fa3c79-6531-4038-97cd-48fcde70e856)\n\nContrary to popular belief, Amazon was not the first online bookstore. Book Stacks Unlimited was created in 1992, three years before Amazon. It began as a dial-up bulletin board. They then launched the website Books.com in 1994, which was eventually [acquired by Barnes \u0026 Noble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_Stacks_Unlimited).\n\nNot only did Book Stacks Unlimited offer 500K titles, but they provided features such as editorial book recommendations, book summaries, RealAudio interviews with authors, book search, and more.\n\n## 1994: NetMarket and the First Sale on the Internet\n\n![](/images/__Z8PQBCcf.gif)\n\n[*Image Source*](https://people.apache.org/~jim/NewArchitect/webrevu/1998/05_29/strategists/05_29_98_2.html)\n\nIn 1994, Dan Kohn created NetMarket, which would sell a variety of CDs and books. He then marked the [first sale of a product over the internet using a credit card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetMarket): a Ten Summoner’s Tale CD by Sting.\n\nAccording to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/12/business/attention-shoppers-internet-is-open.html), which covered the story back then, this was the first retail transaction on the Internet using a readily available version of powerful data encryption software designed to guarantee privacy. Dan Kohn [said about the purchase](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/12/business/attention-shoppers-internet-is-open.html) that “even if the N.S.A. was listening in, they couldn't get his credit card number.”\n\n## 1994-1999: The Launch of Ecommerce Giants\n\n### 1994: PizzaNet (PizzaHut)\n\n![](/images/e_fChIFFJG.png)\n\n[*Image Source*](https://web.archive.org/web/20140123215657/https://www.pizzahut.com/assets/pizzanet/home.html)\n\nIn 1994, PizzaHut created PizzaNet, their online ordering service. Not only did it allow customers to order from the menu, but it also allowed them to [customize the pizza](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-08-25-fi-31168-story.html).\n\nIn the skepticism of how the website might be used, the local restaurant would always call the customer to verify the order to minimize the risk of pranksters.\n\n### 1995: Amazon\n\n![](/images/9WFJUOhR9E.png)\n\n[*Image Source*](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/amazon-1995)\n\nAmazon launched in 1995 as a book store. Although the design wasn’t too appealing, there were features that were advanced for its time: a virtual shopping cart, secure way of entering credit card details, an internal search engine, product reviews, and more.\n\nIn the very beginning, Amazon’s engineers used [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language\\)) to code a lot of the features of the website, and used [Berkeley DB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_DB) to store the website’s data.\n\n### 1996: eBay\n\n![](/images/8Lu58_fxwo.png)\n\n[*Image Source*](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/ebay-1996)\n\neBay (initially Auction Web) was launched in 1996. It was one of its kind, being the first online auction website providing a [person-to-person marketplace](https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~magnus/ief248a/eBay/history.html). Buyers would present their products, and customers bid on the items to eventually purchase it.\n\neBay was free of charge at the start. However, as their traffic hugely increased, [eBay’s founders were informed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay) that they needed to upgrade their hosting account. This led them to take commissions on bids to fund the website.\n\n### 1997: Apple\n\n![](/images/6jszNsuSyc.webp)\n\n[*Image Source*](https://www.versionmuseum.com/history-of/apple-website)\n\nSteve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997. His first line-of-action was to improve Apple’s presence in the ecommerce world. Apple launched their new-and-improved ecommerce website at the end of 1997 aimed at [improving customer experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Store).\n\n### 1998-1999: Nike\n\n![](/images/omqdCPbqTu.webp)\n\n[*Image Source*](https://theecommmanager.com/ecommerce/ecommerce-sites-from-history-old-screenshots/)\n\nNike created their first website in 1997. However, it was mainly focused on teaching their consumers more about Nike and their products, rather than selling these products online.\n\nIn 1998, the Nike website improved to provide consumers the ability to [customize their own Nike shoes](https://www.shoepalace.com/blogs/all/the-history-of-nike). It wasn’t until 1999 that Nike moved from editorial content to an online store.\n\n## 2000-2005: Dot-Com Crash\n\nIn the 1990s, the Internet garnered heavy attention and adoption. Web-based startups gained a lot of funding, and all companies suddenly needed to “move to the internet”. Later followed what is now known as the Dot-Com Crash in March 2000 where the Nasdaq index slipped ~77% over less than three years.\n\nThe dot-com crash took down many ecommerce and internet-based companies that gained success during the 1990s. This affected even big companies like Amazon. Still, some companies like [eBay thrived despite the headwinds](https://www.itbusiness.ca/news/how-ebay-canada-survived-the-dot-com-bust/5053).\n\n### SnowDevil and Shopify\n\nIn 2004, SnowDevil was launched, which ended up being [the spark that ignited Shopify](https://producthabits.com/shopify-grew-snowboard-shop-10b-commerce-ecosystem/). Tobias Lütke and Scott Lake wanted to sell snowboards online, but couldn’t find a software that would help them do that.\n\nThey initially used a variety of tools and services such as Miva, OsCommerce, and Yahoo stores. However, they frequently ran into trouble when trying to bring their vision to life. [According to Lütke](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2378-qa-with-tobias-ltke-of-shopify) they had a “great CSS-based layout done with all these new fanged ‘web standards’”. However, the lack of customization capability that Yahoo provided barely allowed him to change the background color of the top frame.\n\n![](/images/FN1UzFqeHw.png)\n\nSo, Lütke and Lake set out to create a solution that would not only solve their problem, but solve the problems of businesses across the globe. They built Shopify in 2007 and transformed SnowDevil to a Shopify demo store, bringing their vision to life.\n\nShopify now powers over [4.5 million websites](https://trends.builtwith.com/shop/Shopify) worldwide.\n\n### Note on 2000s Designs\n\nWhen looking back at some of the designs from the early 2000s, you’ll notice that there was a significant advancement from the HTML, almost only text and disarrayed images design that dominated that 1990s.\n\n![](/images/lykPkVuVRy.png)\n\n[*Image Source*](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/timeline/amazon-2001)\n\nEven though the design was still clunky and crammed, there was a clear usage of layouts and different colors. Ecommerce websites at the time also started using some elements that are now basics to ecommerce, such as a navigation menu and a sidebar for categories.\n\nDuring that period, tech giants like Amazon and eBay continued to innovate with new features that are now core ecommerce features. Amazon added features like [Search Inside the Book](https://press.aboutamazon.com/2003/10/amazon-com-announces-sales-impact-from-new-search-inside-the-book-feature), allowing customers to search for words inside books. eBay also added a Live Chat feature to provide support for customers.\n\n![](/images/KCswmchaw3.png)\n\n[*Image Source*](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/timeline/ebay-2002)\n\n## 2006-2010: Rise of Ecommerce Platforms\n\nAfter the dot-com crash, ecommerce companies and stores steadily regained momentum, and new ecommerce platforms emerged.\n\nIn 2007, Magento was created by Varien, and it was later [acquired by eBay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magento). In the beginning, Varien were building their platform on osCommerce. However, they found it [incapable of accommodating all the features](https://www.icecubedigital.com/blog/what-is-magento-its-history-facts-usage-more/) and functionalities they had in mind. So, they decided to build a new open-source solution from scratch.\n\nWith the passing years, Magento grew to be one of the top open source ecommerce platforms at its time. In its first year, it was downloaded over 500K times. Magento’s popularity is due to the customizability capabilities it provided, as well as its open source nature. This allowed businesses to break away from proprietary solutions and take full ownership of their store.\n\n![](/images/peVhSZ9erZ.jpg)\n\n[*Image Source*](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magento_Admin_Panel_screenshot.jpg)\n\nBigCommerce was launched in 2009, after its founders met in a [programming online chat](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2727-bootstrapped-profitable-proud-bigcommerce). BigCommerce initially wanted to provide a shopping-cart-only solution called Interspire. However, their consumers found it difficult to manually find, install, and update their software on a server, which lead to the change from Interspire to BigCommerce.\n\nBigCommerce gained popularity among businesses that didn’t want the hassle of handling the technical parts of ecommerce, but still wanted to have the customizability options that allowed them to grow and scale. By 2011, BigCommerce was powering almost 10K stores.\n\n![](/images/p4Hs4dQqZO.png)\n\n[*Image Source*](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2727-bootstrapped-profitable-proud-bigcommerce)\n\n## 2010-2020: The Platform Puzzle\n\nAs the 2010s started, ecommerce saw a rapid uptake, and over the decade, [global ecommerce sales grew 8-fold](https://tblocks.com/how-e-commerce-has-changed-over-the-last-10-years).\n\nDuring this period, ecommerce saw a lot of shifts in user behavior as new platforms emerged, effectively reshaping how users interacted with brands online.\n\n### Design Changes\n\nThe 2010s show a big improvement in the design and functionalities that ecommerce stores provided. Many of the features that were carefully implemented in the 1990s and early 2000s became fundamentals that every ecommerce store had.\n\n![](/images/RB8K80noFH.jpg)\n\nWith more businesses moving towards the ecommerce landscape, they each needed to stand out through unique branding and design. Ecommerce platforms that started emerging in the late 2000s provided more customizable options for the storefront.\n\nThis also lead to newer technologies, concepts, and approaches rising that would reshape websites in general, including ecommerce storefronts. Concepts like [Jamstack](https://www.netlify.com/press/unite-modern-web-ecosystem-at-jamstack-conf-2022), coined by Netlify in 2015, and the launch of static-site generator frameworks like Gatsby or Next.js, allowed businesses to have more control over designing their storefront and provide a better user experience.\n\n### Mobile Commerce\n\nThe 2010s also marked the rise of mobile commerce. Ecommerce businesses started rolling out mobile apps that allowed their consumers to access the same web functionalities from their smartphones. This went through its own timeline of evolution, starting from a simple design and advancing to more sleek and user-experience tailored design.\n\nThis elevated the development of ecommerce stores from only catering to a website to multiple platforms. Developers needed to design and build APIs within their existing systems to cater for mobile development.\n\n![](/images/EaVETdC2Qk.jpg)\n\n[*Image Source*](https://www.talkandroid.com/43842-ebay-app-gets-updated-you-can-now-sell-items-from-your-phone/)\n\n### Social Commerce\n\nIn the mid 2010s, social commerce started emerging. In 2015, Pinterest rolled out its first shopping capabilities through [Buyable Pins](https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/02/pinterest-unveils-buyable-pins-a-way-to-purchase-things-directly-from-pinterest/). Users were able to purchase products from Pinterest. [Instagram also announced Instagram Shop in 2018](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/17/instagram-launches-new-shopping-features.html) which allows users to browse and purchase products from businesses without leaving Instagram.\n\nWith the introduction of social commerce, businesses had now another platform to attract new customers. Businesses invested in social marketing strategies to ensure potential customers can discover their products through these platforms and, in turn, convert to purchasing customers.\n\n![](/images/_9knLd28ij.gif)\n\n[*Image Source*](https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/02/pinterest-unveils-buyable-pins-a-way-to-purchase-things-directly-from-pinterest/)\n\n### Stripe and the Emergence of New Ecommerce Infrastructure\n\nWhile ecommerce platforms evolved, a new type of infrastructure started to emerge to further improve the commerce experience. From analytics and backend-focused tools, to new solutions solving complicated issues related to areas such as payment and distribution.\n\nThe brothers Patrick and John Collison founded one of the most notable infrastructure solutions in this new commerce era in 2010. Through their side projects, they found it difficult to accept payment online and wanted to fix that. So, they developed a quick solution in [2 weeks](https://www.zippia.com/stripe-careers-39818/history/) and were able to process their first transaction. After making several iterations over the next few months, they launched Stripe under the name dev/payments.\n\n![](/images/fXJNnaVyts.png)\n\n[*Image Source*](https://vator.tv/news/2016-12-29-when-stripe-was-young-the-early-years)\n\nAs indicated by its initial name, Stripe was aimed towards developers at first. The founders then realized that Stripe solves problems the entire internet faced. [According to Patrick](https://www.fastcompany.com/1813087/inside-stripe-paypal-competitor-backed-paypal-founders-peter-thiel-elon-musk), existing solutions like PayPal and Google Checkout were “these confusing things,” and they wanted to solve what these existing solutions couldn’t.\n\nStripe reshaped the payment landscape, making it easy for anyone to start selling online, while providing a payment infrastructure that facilitated building custom setups. A lot of startups afterward took it upon themselves to cover other areas of the ecommerce infrastructure with similar developer-first approaches.\n\n## 2020s and Ecommerce Modularization\n\nThe ecommerce landscape has evolved to include not only web as a sales channel, but also mobile apps, social apps, and more. This spawned the need for ecommerce solutions that provide [omnichannel](https://medusajs.com/blog/why-headless-commerce-is-the-perfect-solution-for-omnichannel-support/) support, frontend flexibility, and an extensive feature offering.\n\nTo accommodate those needs, the 2020s saw new and existing ecommerce solutions start to adopt [headless](https://medusajs.com/blog/headless-architecture/) and [composable](https://medusajs.com/blog/composable-commerce/) architectures.  As the demands for ecommerce heavily evolved, the previous methods used to create ecommerce applications, which were initially monolithic and tightly coupled, are now limiting. Developers now seek modular solutions that are less rigid and open to customizations. This would remove the restrictions on their businesses and the need for hacky workarounds.\n\nThe rise of point solutions that focus on specific domains within ecommerce has enabled this move towards modular solutions. Developers can combine these services and create a modern product stack that meets businesses’ exact requirements without compromising scalability.\n\nAs ecommerce, and the technology sector as a whole, is a rapidly growing landscape, new trends will continue to rise and fall. However, one thing remains consistent throughout the years: businesses will continue to strive to exceed their current potential. To ensure they can innovate and build unique experiences, ecommerce solutions must adopt a modular approach ensuring scalability and flexibility.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/ecommerce-cart-functionality.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/ecommerce-cart-functionality.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/ecommerce-cart-functionality.md"},"title":"How to Implement Ecommerce Cart Functionality","date":"2023-03-07","excerpt":"This article outlines the crucial aspects to consider for a successful ecommerce cart that satisfies both user needs and technical requirements.","darkTheme":true,"type":"PostLayout","authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-triwipzvl.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-triwipzvl.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-triwipzvl.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Teslim","lastName":"Odumuyiwa","username":"lorem-ipsum","email":"lorem-ipsum","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/avatars/user-avatar-06.png","altText":"Person photo"}}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-29bs7fo47.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json"},"type":"Category","name":"Community"},"featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/ecommerce-cart-min.jpg","altText":"altText of the image","caption":"Caption of the image","objectFit":"cover","elementId":""},"markdown_content":"\n\u003ccallout icon=\"exclamationCircleSolid\" button-label=\"Go to Docs\" button-url=\"http://docs.medusajs.com\"\u003e\n**Notice**\nMedusa is under active development, so the content of this post may be outdated. Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\n\nEcommerce cart functionality is essential for the success of an online store, as it is a way for customers to interact with the store and make their purchases. A properly designed cart can make the shopping experience simple, intuitive, and enjoyable, while a poorly designed cart can frustrate customers and lead to abandoned purchases.\n\n\nThe ecommerce cart plays several important roles in the online shopping process such as allowing customers to manage the products in their carts, display all total information, and more.\n\n\nThis article outlines the crucial aspects to consider for a successful ecommerce cart that satisfies both user needs and technical requirements.\n\n\n\u003e **What is Medusa?** [Medusa](https://medusajs.com/) is an open source set of ecommerce building blocks that aims to provide a flexible developer experience. Developers and business have full freedom in how they shape their ecommerce application, including how they can implement a cart. Learn how to get started with Medusa in [the documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/usage/create-medusa-app).\n\n\n## Cart User Experience Considerations\n\n\nAre you aware that the average shopping [cart abandonment rate is 69.82%](https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate)? The journey doesn't end there despite a customer clicking “add to cart ” on your [product](https://medusajs.com/blog/what-i-learned-from-studying-500-b2b-ecommerce-sites/) page. Several new challenges come into play once a customer places a product into their shopping cart.\n\n\nRemember that getting potential customers to add an item to their cart is just the starting point. It's an opportunity to convert that into a sale. One key factor in achieving this is the [user experience](https://medusajs.com/blog/9-best-ecommerce-ux-practices-with-examples/) of your ecommerce platform.\n\n\n### Allow Users to Add, Remove and View Items in Their Cart\n\n\nCustomers should feel in control, so provide them with the option to delete items from their cart easily. However, you can also include a confirmation pop-up to ensure the action was intentional.\n\n\nMake it simple for customers to edit items in their cart as well. For example, provide options to adjust the quantity with \"+\" or \"-\" buttons, a drop-down menu, or a box for manual entry. As demonstrated in the example below from the [Medusa Next.js](https://medusajs.com/blog/nextjs-ecommerce-storefront-comes-packed-with-ready-integrations-to-paypal-meilisearch-stripe-and-more/) storefront:\n\n\n![](/images/5rDdrNRzxv.png)\n\n\nEnsure that any modifications made to the cart are reflected in the product image and information. The goal is to keep the customer on the cart page and make the buying process seamless. Avoid redirecting customers back to the product page for any changes. The buying journey should be a progressive one.\n\n\n### Be Upfront About Costs\n\n\nTo avoid losing customers, make sure the prices on your cart pages are clear and easy to understand. Hidden fees or unexpected costs can make customers feel tricked and discourage them from completing their purchase. \n\n\n[According to a study by the Baymard Institute, 55% of customers cited](https://baymard.com/blog/ecommerce-checkout-usability-report-and-benchmark) extra costs as the main reason for leaving their cart. To prevent this, clearly display taxes and shipping costs on their own line, along with the subtotal and total cost of the cart. \n\n\nIf these costs vary by location, consider adding a tax, shipping calculator, and conversion rate to your page, so customers can see the costs before they checkout. A perfect example is the Medusa storefront sample used below, which shows the subtotal, shipping, and tax fee with the total cost. \n\n\n![](/images/VWw4fVP4Td.png)\n\n\n### Don’t Force Buyers to Create Accounts\n\n\nMany customers abandon their shopping carts because creating an account on the website can take time and effort.[ In fact, 34% of people who took a survey by the Baymard Institute](https://www.drip.com/blog/cart-abandonment-statistics) cited this as a reason to abandon their shopping carts. To prevent this, offer a \"guest checkout\" option that allows customers to purchase without creating an account. This way, customers can easily complete a purchase, even if they only plan on buying something once and without any fuss.\n\n\n### Offer Different Ways to Pay\n\n\nGiving customers many options to pay will make it more likely for them to complete a purchase. If you don't offer a customer's preferred payment on your website, it may discourage them from finishing their purchase. Offering a limited number of payment options can limit customer choice and decrease the likelihood of a sale. You can start with the most popular payment methods, such as credit and debit cards, PayPal, and Google Pay, then you can expand from there.\n\n\n![Source: Nike Checkout Section](/images/eX9nhVuAZN.png)\n\n\n### Simplify the Checkout Process \n\n\nConsolidating everything on a single page can improve customer experience and increase sales by eliminating multiple clicks and guesswork for shipping costs or account creation. Customers can see all necessary information on a single page, including payment processing, shipping details, and order information.\n\n\n![](/images/iCL7upvb_C.png)\n\n\n### Make Buying on Mobile Easy\n\n\nMany people shop online using their phones. You could lose sales if your checkout process is not easy to use on the phone. Make sure your checkout page is set up for mobile users so they can easily complete their purchases.\n\n\n### Abandoned Cart Recovery\n\n\nThere are several ways to recover abandoned carts, including sending reminder emails, offering incentives, and displaying abandoned items on the customer's next visit to the website. These methods can remind customers of the items left in their cart and encourage them to complete their purchases.\n\n\nOffering special discounts or promotions for completing the purchase can also be effective. Another strategy is to track customer behavior, such as which items are frequently abandoned, and address any issues that may be causing customers to abandon their carts. \n\n\nFrom a technical perspective, you could implement a cron job that checks for newly created carts, if a cart is older than a specific amount of time, it would send an email to remind the customer of their cart and encourage them to complete their purchase.\n\n\nOverall, abandoned cart recovery is an important aspect of ecommerce and can lead to significant increases in sales and revenue.\n\n\n## Cart Technical Considerations\n\n\nImportant things to consider when you create and manage an online store include keeping customer data secure, data storage, website performance, and real-time updates.\n\n\n### Security\n\n\nEnsuring the security of customer information is paramount in an ecommerce site. When choosing a shopping cart solution, you must look for certifications and compliance measures to protect your customers from identity and information theft. \n\n\nInvesting in a shopping cart solution with robust security credentials is crucial to maintaining the trust of your customers. Keeping your customer's information secure and following laws protecting their data is another important part of it. For instance, businesses operating in the EU must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In the US, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are mandatory regulation. \n\n\nThese regulations mandate strict requirements for handling and protecting sensitive customer information.\n\n\n### Sessions, Cookies, and Local Storage\n\n\nStoring items in a cart between visits is crucial for an ecommerce website. One way to accomplish this is by using sessions, cookies, and local storage. Both are used to store information about the customer's cart on their browser. \n\n\nSessions are saved on the website's computer and only last as long as the customer’s tab is opened on the browser. Another session is created if the customer opens another tab for the same site. Once the customer closes the tab, the session is destroyed. Cookies are saved on the customer's computer and can last even if the customer closes the tab or browser. Local storage is a type of web storage that allows web applications to store and access data on the client side (i.e., in the user's web browser) with no expiration.\n\n\nThis lets customers easily pick up where they left off and complete their purchase. Utilizing one of these options ensures customers a smooth and convenient shopping experience.\n\n\nAn example of using local storage is storing cart ID in local storage. The CartID is retrieved from the server stored in the browser's local storage.\n\n\n```javascript\n// Generate a unique cart ID\nvar cartId = \"\u003cvalue\u003e\";\n\n// Store the cart ID in local storage\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"cartId\", cartId);\n```\n\n\nThis code retrieves the cart information by retrieving the cartID stored in the local storage and then sends the cartID to make a request to the server, which fetches the cart details.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst cartId = localStorage.getItem(\"cartId\")\nif (cartId){\n\tfetch(`/cart?cartId=${cartId}`, {\n      method: 'GET',\n      headers: {\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n      }\n    })\n\t.then((response) =\u003e response.json())\n\t.then(({ cart }) =\u003e {\n\t\t//display cart details\n\t})\n}\n```\n\n\nThis implementation above shows how cookies and local storage could be used together to manage a shopping cart. The cart ID is stored locally to allow the client to retrieve the cart information from the server.\n\n\n### Real-Time Price Update\n\n\nUpdating the shopping cart and total price in real-time as the user makes changes is possible using JavaScript event listeners. For example, when a user clicks on the \"add to cart\" button, the JavaScript code will update the cart object and re-render the cart UI to reflect the change. \n\n\nSimilarly, when a user changes the quantity of an item or removes an item from the cart, the JavaScript code will update the cart object and recalculate the total price. You can do this by assigning event listeners to the \"add to cart\", \"remove from cart\", and \"quantity change\" buttons.\n\n\nAdditionally, the total price displayed on the page should be updated to reflect the changes. This is just a basic example, you might need to follow extra steps to handle situations like trying to add an item that's unavailable yet or adding the same item more than once.\n\n\nThe site's performance must be considered, as recalculating the total price on every change may negatively affect the performance. Here is an example of how you might implement real-time updating of the cart and total price using JavaScript:\n\n\nNote: This implementation focuses solely on client-side storage of the cart information. In a real-world scenario, communication with the server would be necessary to ensure the cart information is updated and accurate.\n\n\n```bash\n// Assign event listeners to the add to cart, remove from cart, and quantity change buttons\ndocument.getElementById(\"add-to-cart-button\").addEventListener(\"click\", addToCart);\ndocument.getElementById(\"remove-from-cart-button\").addEventListener(\"click\", removeFromCart);\ndocument.getElementById(\"quantity-change-button\").addEventListener(\"change\", updateQuantity);\n\n// Cart object to store the items in the cart\nlet cart = {};\n\n// Function to add an item to the cart\nfunction addToCart() {\n    // Get item details from the page\n    let item = {\n        id: document.getElementById(\"item-id\").value,\n        name: document.getElementById(\"item-name\").value,\n        price: document.getElementById(\"item-price\").value\n    }\n\t\t// Call the calculate total price function\n\t\tcalculateTotalPrice()\n\n    // Add the item to the cart object\n    cart[item.id] = item;\n\n    // Re-render the cart UI to reflect the change\n    renderCart();\n}\n\n// Function to remove an item from the cart\nfunction removeFromCart() {\n    // Get the id of the item to be removed\n    let itemId = document.getElementById(\"item-id-to-remove\").value;\n\n    // Remove the item from the cart object\n    delete cart[itemId];\n\n    // Re-render the cart UI to reflect the change\n    renderCart();\n\n\t// Call the calculate total price function\n\t\tcalculateTotalPrice()\n\n}\n\n// Function to update the quantity of an item in the cart\nfunction updateQuantity() {\n    // Get the id of the item and the new quantity\n    let itemId = document.getElementById(\"item-id-to-update\").value;\n    let newQuantity = document.getElementById(\"new-quantity\").value;\n\n    // Update the quantity in the cart object\n    cart[itemId].quantity = newQuantity;\n\n    // Re-calculate the total price\n    let totalPrice = calculateTotalPrice();\n\n    // Update the total price displayed on the page\n    document.getElementById(\"total-price\").innerHTML = totalPrice;\n}\n\n// Function to calculate the total price of the items in the cart\nfunction calculateTotalPrice() {\n    let totalPrice = 0;\n    for (let itemId in cart) {\n        totalPrice += cart[itemId].price * cart[itemId].quantity;\n    }\n    return totalPrice;\n}\n\n// Function to render the cart UI\nfunction renderCart() {\n    // Clear the existing cart UI\n    document.getElementById(\"cart\").innerHTML = \"\";\n\n    // Iterate through the items in the cart and render them\n    for (let itemId in cart) {\n        let item = cart[itemId];\n        let itemElement = document.createElement(\"div\");\n        itemElement.innerHTML = `\u003cp\u003e${item.name} - $${item.price} x ${item.quantity}\u003c/p\u003e`;\n        document.getElementById(\"cart\").appendChild(itemElement);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n### Handling Out-of-Stock Items and Inventory Updates\n\n\nWhen running an online store, it's essential to have a plan for handling things like items that are out of stock or inventory changes. A good way to handle items that are out of stock is to offer related or replacement items, for example, “Sorry, Nike Air Force 1 is out of stock, but we have the Nike Air Force 2 available.”\n\n\nAnother option is to show a message saying when the item will be back in stock and offer an option for customers to sign up for a mail notification to notify them when the item is available.\n\n\nYou can also let customers backorder items and ship them when they become available. Use inventory software to keep track of stock and update the website in real time. Also, let customers know when an item they're interested in is back in stock via email or a notification.\n\n\nLimit the number of items a customer can purchase to the available stock and clearly communicate the item's status to customers so they can make informed decisions.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\nIn this article, we cover essential functionalities of an ecommerce cart from the user and technical standpoint, including responsiveness on mobile devices, access to various payment methods, offering guest accounts to new customers, handling out-of-stock items, real-time price updates, and saving the cart information in cookies.\n\n\nLearn more about how to make a great online store with the Medusa quickstart guide [here](https://docs.medusajs.com/usage/create-medusa-app).\n\n\nThe documentation also provides two important guides related to carts:\n\n- [How to implement a cart functionality](https://docs.medusajs.com/guides/carts-in-medusa)\n- [How to implement checkout flow](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/storefront/how-to-implement-checkout-flow)\n\nFor any questions or support, you can reach the Medusa team through [Discord](https://discord.gg/medusajs).\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/ecommerce-architecture.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/ecommerce-architecture.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/ecommerce-architecture.md"},"title":"Ecommerce Architecture: Design and Types","date":"2023-02-28","excerpt":"This article breaks down the most common ecommerce architectures; Monolith vs. Microservices, Two- vs. three-tier","darkTheme":true,"type":"PostLayout","authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-oh4qb9784.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-oh4qb9784.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-oh4qb9784.json"},"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Padilla","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/Carlos.webp","altText":"Person photo"},"type":"Person"}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-29bs7fo47.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json"},"type":"Category","name":"Community"},"seo_description":"Ecommerce architecture refers to the technical design and infrastructure of an ecommerce websites.

Choosing a particular ecommerce architecture is a fundamental decision. It will impact several critical aspects of the business, like scalability, maintenance, upgradeability, cost security, and performance.\n\n## Ecommerce Architecture Types\n\nThere are several common ecommerce architecture patterns, including monolithic architecture, microservices, two or three tiers architecture, [composable](https://medusajs.com/blog/composable-commerce/), [headless](https://medusajs.com/blog/headless-architecture/), serverless, or cloud-based architectures.\n\nArchitectures have different trade-offs, and the best one depends on the specific needs of the business and the resources available.\n\n## Monolith Vs. Microservices Ecommerce Architecture\n\n### Monolith Architecture\n\nThe [monolithic](https://medusajs.com/blog/composable-commerce/) architecture model is a unified system that includes all features in a large codebase. In this type of architecture, the ecommerce solution connects to a database. It contains components such as a user interface, data access layer, and business logic layer.\n\nWhile monolithic architecture is a traditional method of software development, it has some benefits and drawbacks.\n\n![](/images/0oF__MG7oR.png)\n\n### Pros of a Monolithic Architecture\n\n*   It's simple to implement and maintain as all the functionality is contained in one place.\n*   There are fewer external components and less probability of things going wrong because everything is integrated.\n*   Developing and testing new features is quicker because all the functionality is in one place.\n*   Less expensive to set up and maintain than more complex architectures.\n\n### Cons of a Monolithic Architecture\n\n*   As the business and traffic grow, scaling can become challenging and may lead to bottlenecks.\n*   Inflexible and demanding to change, making it hard to adapt to new business requirements or integrate with other systems.\n*   Updating, testing, or replacing one system piece can be difficult and risky because all the functionality is combined.\n*   A failure in one component can affect the entire system, which makes it hard to isolate and fix the problem.\n\n### Microservice Architecture\n\nA microservice architecture involves breaking down the ecommerce system into small and independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. The main advantage of this approach is that each microservice operates as a subsystem with its specific business logic. This architecture allows for greater scalability and flexibility.\n\n![](/images/fveftgmdc0.png)\n\n### Pros of a Microservice Architecture\n\n*   Easier to scale individual services as needed without affecting the entire system.\n*   More flexibility regarding technology choices and distribution of tasks among development teams.\n*   Microservices can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.\n*   The failure of one service does not affect the entire system allowing for a more fault-tolerant system.\n*   Better integration with other systems complementing a commerce website, such as CRM, CMS, or payment gateways. Businesses benefit from best-in-breed solutions without the need to reinvent the wheel.\n\n### Cons of a Microservice Architecture\n\n*   More complex to implement and maintain, especially for teams with less experience.\n*   There is increased communication overhead, which can slow down the system and increase the risk of errors.\n*   Development, deployment, and maintenance can be more expensive than a monolithic one. It requires more infrastructure and specialized skill sets.\n\n## Two- Vs. Three-tier Ecommerce Architecture\n\nTwo-tier and three-tier architectures are different ways of organizing the components of an ecommerce system. The three-tier architecture has an extra layer between the client and server, allowing for more scalability and new features.\n\n### Two-tier Architecture\n\nA two-tier architecture is where the client (interface layer) communicates directly with the ecommerce platform's data layer. This architecture is straightforward but can become limiting as the business grows. It makes it challenging to add new functionality or scale the system.\n\n![](/images/sXePhyVQKu.png)\n\n### Pros of a Two-tier Architecture\n\n*   Easy to understand and work with because all the functionality is contained in the client. It's quicker to develop, add and test new features.\n*   Reduces network traffic and improves data processing efficiency by optimizing input-output and using buffering techniques.\n*   The server uses transaction control to prevent concurrent modifications to the same records.\n*   Less expensive to set up and maintain than more complex architectures.\n\n### Cons of a Two-tier Architecture\n\n*   Challenging to scale and may lead to bottlenecks as the business and traffic grow.\n*   Inflexible and challenging to change, making it hard to adapt to new business requirements.\n*   The business logic and data presentation may be the same for multiple client applications, increasing the need for resources.\n*   It doesn't provide an additional layer for protection and validation, making it more vulnerable to attacks.\n\n### Three-tier Architecture\n\nA three-tier architecture contains an additional \"middle tier\" between the client and the server. This middle tier typically manages the client and server data flow. It can also handle authentication, security, and data validation functions.\n\n![](/images/5K6X6ygKAF.png)\n\n### Pros of a Three-tier Architecture\n\n*   Each layer can be developed by a separate development team, which gives more flexibility regarding technology choices.t\n*   Components can be reused across different platform parts, allowing for cost savings and faster development.\n*   It provides an additional layer for security and validation, improving data integrity as the client lacks direct access to the database.\n\n### Cons of a Three-tier Architecture\n\n*   Different layers may only be able to handle an increase in traffic or data volume with significant modifications. It makes it difficult to scale\n*   A three-tier architecture's development, deployment, and maintenance can be more expensive than a two-tier one.\n*   Maintenance and upgrades can be more complex and time-consuming, as changes must be made to multiple layers and components.\n*   More steps are involved in processing a request, which can lead to increased latency and slower response times for customers.\n\n## Composable and Headless Ecommerce Architecture\n\n### Headless Architecture\n\nIn a headless ecommerce architecture, the front-end presentation layer of the ecommerce platform is separated from the back-end functionality.\n\nThe front-end (head) displays the user interface and handles user interactions. On the other hand, the back-end (body) handles specific functionality such as inventory management, order processing, and payment processing.\n\n![](/images/Z_EuBwy06T.png)\n\n### Pros of a Headless Architecture\n\n*   Greater flexibility in terms of the technologies used for the front-end and back-end.\n*   Better integration with other systems, such as CMS, CRM, or payment gateways.\n*   Better separation of concerns can improve performance, making it easier to optimize the front-end for a faster and better customer experience and the back end for better scalability and security.\n*   Future-proofing for more straightforward adaptation to new technologies and emerging trends, such as Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) and voice assistants.\n\n### Cons of a Headless Architecture\n\n*   More complex to implement and maintain, especially for small businesses with a limited developer team.\n*   Increased communication overhead can slow down the system and increase the risk of errors.\n*   Development, deployment, and maintenance can be more expensive than traditional commerces.\n*   Requires a different set of skills, expertise, and more robust integration between the front-end and back-end.\n\n### Composable Architecture\n\nA composable commerce architecture is an approach where the ecommerce platform comprises small and independent services. They can be combined and configured differently to meet specific business needs.\n\nThese services can be developed and deployed independently. Also, they can be composed to create a customized composable commerce solution that can be easily scaled and adapted to business requirements.\n\n![](/images/slpWgdfDhf.png)\n\n### Pros of a Composable Architecture\n\n*   Different services can be swapped in and out as needed.\n*   New services can be added to the platform without affecting the existing functionality.\n*   Services can be scaled independently, depending on the usage.\n*   More control over the ecommerce platform to optimize it for specific business needs.\n*   Code and functionality can be reused across different services, resulting in cost savings and faster development.\n\n### Cons of a Composable Architecture\n\n*   More complex implementation and maintenance, especially for teams with less experience.\n*   The system can slow down and increase the risk of errors because services communicate through APIs.\n*   Higher operational costs because it requires more infrastructure and specialized skill sets.\n\n## What Ecommerce Architecture to Choose\n\nA well-designed architecture can improve the platform's performance, scalability, and security, making it easier to adapt to new business requirements. On the other hand, a poorly-designed architecture can limit the growth and success of the business.\n\n### Consider your Current Architecture\n\nWhen evaluating the current architecture of an ecommerce platform, it's essential to consider the following factors:\n\n*   Scalability: Can the current architecture handle large quantities of users and transactions? Will it be able to drive future growth?\n*   Flexibility: Can the current architecture adapt to new business requirements and changing technologies? Can ecommerce be easily integrated with other systems?\n*   Performance: Is the current architecture optimized for fast load times and responsive user interactions?\n*   Security: Can the current architecture protect sensitive customer data and transactions from potential security threats?\n*   Reusability: Is the current architecture designed to allow code and functionality to be reused across different platform parts?\n*   Cost-effective: Is the current architecture cost-effective for development, deployment, and maintenance?\n\nOnce you have assessed the current architecture against these factors, you should clearly understand whether it fits your business's needs. If the present architecture works, keep using it. If not, look for an alternative that better fits your business needs.\n\n### Find the Architecture that Best Fits your Future Ecommerce Needs\n\nKnowing your business's future requirements allows you to make an informed decision about the architecture and features of your ecommerce platform. This ensures your business's growth and success.\n\nThe ecommerce landscape constantly evolves, and new technologies and trends are always emerging. Ensure your platform is up-to-date with trends and tech to keep growing and succeeding.\n\nFor example, ecommerce businesses looking for a simpler and cheaper solution can use a monolithic or two-tier architecture. However, companies that need to scale and customize their business quickly may benefit from microservices, headless, or composable architectures.\n\nModern ecommerce systems could choose three-tier or composable architectures if they need security, performance, and integrations with other systems.\n\n## Medusa’s Ecommerce Architecture\n\n[Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) provides a set of open source ecommerce building blocks for developers to build bespoke commerce setups. This way, businesses avoid platform lock-in and gridlocks and can instead start from a scaleable foundation.\n\nDifferent services in Medusa are independent and can be combined differently.

Part of my work includes managing the content on our blog and across platforms. Typically, we publish an article on our [blog](https://medusajs.com/blog/) (which is built with [Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/)), then cross-post that article across platforms such as Dev.to, Hashnode, and Medium.\n\nThis process has become tedious and time-consuming. We publish at least 2 articles per week, and each article can take more than 30 minutes to be published across our blog and the 3 mentioned platforms. This includes adding the content in the format that each platform supports, uploading images if there are any, setting meta attributes such as description and meta tags, and more.\n\nSo, I decided to build a cross posting tool that would automate this task. [cross-post-notion](https://github.com/shahednasser/cross-post-notion) now allows us to publish an article from Notion to a GitHub repository (which holds the content of our main blog), Dev.to, Hashnode, and Medium in less than a minute. I decided to build this tool as part of our Discovery Days at Medusa.\n\n## What are Discovery Days?\n\nEvery Friday, the Medusa team members can dedicate half or their full day towards doing something different from their typical daily work. You can use this day to learn something new, read a book specific to your field, try out an interesting tool, or build a new tool.\n\nAs I realized this tool would heavily reduce the time I spend on publishing content to our blog, I dedicated the past 4 Discovery Days (Fridays) to building this tool.\n\n## How it Works\n\nYou can use `cross-post-notion` either as an NPX command, as a global CLI tool, or just by cloning the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/shahednasser/cross-post-notion#notion).\n\nThen, after adding the configurations necessary (more on this later), you can publish to all the different platforms using one command. You can also choose specific platforms to publish to.\n\n### Publishing to GitHub\n\nPublishing to GitHub can be useful for any blogging platform that uses Markdown files hosted in a GitHub repository. This includes Stackbit, GitHub Pages, 11ty, Hugo, Docusaurus, etc…\n\nArticles are pushed to GitHub as Markdown files with front matter metadata. The front matter includes by default the `title` and `date` of the article. The values of these fields are extracted from your Notion document, and you can specify the properties to extract these fields from.\n\nIn addition, you can specify custom front matter fields to add and from which properties to extract them from Notion. You can also specify front matter fields with fixed values. This is helpful if you have front matter fields that you need to always add to your articles.\n\nIf an article has images, the images are pushed to the GitHub repository as well. You can specify the path to upload the images to and the prefix to use within the article.\n\n### Publishing to Dev.to\n\nYou can publish articles to dev.to with this tool, either on your personal account, or in an organization. Similar to posting to GitHub, the values of dev.to fields such as the title, tags, or series can all be extracted from Notion properties.\n\nOne limitation to publishing to dev.to is that you can’t upload the images in the article using their APIs. So, you’ll still have to manually go in and upload any images in your article.\n\n### Publishing to Hashnode\n\nYou can publish articles to Hashnode with this tool, either on your personal blog or in a specific publication. Similar to the other platforms, the values of Hashnode fields are extracted from Notion properties.\n\nOne limitation to publishing to Hashnode is that it’s not possible to publish an article as a draft with their APIs. It’s only possible to choose to hide it from Hashnode’s feed. So, the article will automatically be available to your followers.\n\n### Publishing to Medium\n\nYou can publish articles to Medium with this tool, either on your personal account or in a specific publication. Similar to the other platforms, the values of Medium fields are extracted from Notion properties.\n\n## Using this Tool\n\n### Requirements\n\nThis tool requires an Internal Notion Integration created and installed in your Notion workspace. The integration must have access to the pages you want to publish as well. You can learn more about this in [Notion’s documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#step-1-create-an-integration).\n\n### Install the Tool\n\nThere are three ways you can use this tool:\n\n1\\.  With NPX, which does not directly install the tool on your machine:\n\n```\nnpx cross-post-notion\n```\n\n2\\.  Install as a global CLI tool with NPM or Yarn:\n\n```\n# using NPM\nnpm install -g cross-post-notion\n\n# using Yarn\nyarn add cross-post-notion global\n```\n\n3\\.  Clone the GitHub repository:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/shahednasser/cross-post-notion.git\ncd cross-post-notion\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\n\n### Set Environment Variables\n\nYou need to set the following environment variables before you can use the tool. The requirements of the environment variables depends on which platforms you want to publish to:\n\n*   Notion:\n    *   `NOTION_TOKEN`: (required for all platforms) Token on a Notion internal integration\n*   GitHub:\n    *   `GH_TOKEN`: (required) GitHub personal token\n    *   `GH_OWNER`: (required) GitHub username\n    *   `GH_REPO`: (required) GitHub Repository name\n    *   `GH_BRANCH`: Branch name. Default is `master`.\n*   Dev.to:\n    *   `DEVTO_API_KEY`: (required) Your personal dev.to API key. Learn how to retrieve it [here](https://developers.forem.com/api/v0).\n    *   `DEVTO_ORG_ID`: The ID of the organization to publish the article under. You can retrieve it either from the organization dashboard page, where the ID is the last part of the URL (`https://dev.to/dashboard/organization/ORG_ID`). Alternatively, you can use Dev.to's [List Organizations](https://developers.forem.com/api/v0#tag/organizations/operation/getOrgUsers) endpoint to find the ID.\n*   Hashnode:\n    *   `HASHNODE_TOKEN`: (required) Hashnode personal token\n    *   `HASHNODE_PUB_ID`: The ID of the publication to publish the article under. You can retrieve it either from the publication's dashboard page, where the ID is the second part of the URL (`https://hashnode.com/PUB_ID/dashboard`).\n*   Medium:\n    *   `MEDIUM_TOKEN`: (required) Medium Integration Token. Can be retrieved from [here](https://medium.com/me/settings/security).\n    *   `MEDIUM_PUB_NAME`: The name of the Medium publication. Must be the exact name as it is on Medium.\n\n### Add Configurations\n\nConfigurations are used to customize how the article is published on the different platforms. They can be used to define what properties to extract data from in Notion, whether the article should be published or added as a draft, and more. You only need to set these configurations the first time you use the tool.\n\nBy default, configurations are loaded from the file `config/default.json` relative to the current directory you’re running the command from. Alternatively, you can pass the [path to the config file as an option](https://github.com/shahednasser/cross-post-notion#config).\n\nThe file can have the following configurations:\n\n```\n{\n  \"config\": {\n    \"notion\": {\n      \"options\": {\n        \"skip_block_types\": [\n\t        \"toggle\"\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    \"github\": {\n      \"options\": {\n        \"image_path\": \"public\",\n        \"image_prefix\": \"/\",\n        \"article_path\": \"content\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"title\": \"Title for Blog\",\n          \"date\": \"Publishing Date\",\n          \"slug\": \"Slug\"\n        },\n        \"add_default_frontmatter\": true,\n        \"frontmatter_labels\": {\n          \"title\": \"title\",\n          \"date\": \"date\"\n        },\n        \"extra_frontmatter\": {\n          \"excerpt\": \"this is description\"\n        },\n        \"extra_frontmatter_mapper\": {\n          \"excerpt\": \"Description\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"devto\": {\n      \"options\": {\n        \"should_publish\": false,\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"title\": \"Title for Dev.to\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"hashnode\": {\n      \"options\": {\n        \"should_publish\": true,\n        \"should_notify_followers\": false,\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"title\": \"Title for Hashnode\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"medium\": {\n      \"options\": {\n        \"should_publish\": false,\n        \"should_notify_followers\": false,\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"title\": \"Title for Medium\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can learn what each of these fields are and what more fields can be accepted in [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/shahednasser/cross-post-notion#available-configurations).\n\n### Run Post Command\n\nGrab the URL of a Notion document that includes an article you want to publish. It should be an internal URL which you can obtain from the Notion document by:\n\n*   Click on Share at the top right.\n*   Click on “Copy link” at the bottom of the pop-up.\n\nThen, run the following command:\n\n```\n# using NPX\nnpx cross-post-notion post \u003curl\u003e\n\n# using CLI tool\ncross-post-notion post \u003curl\u003e\n\n# using cloned repository\nnpm start post \u003curl\u003e\n```\n\nWhere `\u003curl\u003e` is the URL to the Notion document.\n\nIf all environment variables are set correctly, you should see logged in your terminal that the article was published on each of the platforms.\n\nYou can also specify which platforms you want to publish the article on using the `-p` option:\n\n```\nnpx cross-post-notion post \u003curl\u003e -p devto hashnode\n```\n\nThis would publish the article only on [Dev.to](http://Dev.to) and Hashnode.\n\n## Learn More about this Tool\n\nYou can learn more about this tool and its limitations by checking out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/shahednasser/cross-post-notion).

It also separates the admin panel from the backend. Making changes in one part, either backend, admin, or storefront doesn’t affect the other. This will help developers know where to focus when fixing a bug.\n*   Strong Community Support: Medusa provides 24/7 community support through its Discord channel.\n\n## What is Stripe?\n\n[Stripe](https://stripe.com/payments) is a payment processing platform that provides a simple, secure way for businesses to accept payments online. It offers a range of tools and services for processing transactions, including support for credit and debit card payments and other forms of payment such as Apple Pay and Google Pay.\n\nStripe provides a comprehensive set of APIs and libraries that make it easy for developers to integrate its payment processing capabilities into their websites and applications.\n\n## Why use Stripe?\n\n*   Secure Payments: Stripe uses industry-standard security measures to ensure that all transactions are secure and compliant with regulations.\n*   Scalability: Stripe can handle large numbers of transactions and can easily scale to meet the needs of growing businesses.\n*   Robust Feature Set: Stripe offers a variety of features, including subscriptions, recurring payments, and fraud detection, which can help businesses streamline their payment process.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore starting this tutorial, ensure you have the following ready:\n\n*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or later)\n*   [Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) account (with API keys ready)\n*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) installation\n*   [Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup) account\n\n## Creating a Medusa Project\n\nA Medusa project is composed of the server, storefront, and admin. All these will be installed using a single command line.\n\nIn your terminal, run the following command:\n\n```\nnpx create-medusa-app\n```\n\nWhile the above command is running, you’ll be asked to enter the name of the directory you want the project to be installed. You can either leave the default value `my-medusa-store` or enter a new name.\n\n![](/images/soXuhnfut0.png)\n\nNext, choose the Medusa server starter. The Medusa server is created from a starter template. By default, it is created from the `medusa-starter-default` template. So choose `medusa-starter-default` to enable you to follow up with this project.\n\n![](/images/oUPfw773kf.png)\n\nDoing this will install the server under the directory `my-medusa-store/backend`. It will also create an SQLite database inside that directory with demo data seeded into it.\n\nAfter choosing the Medusa starter, the next prompt will ask you to choose the storefront starter. Choose Next.js Starter which is what you will use for this project storefront.\n\n![](/images/1Zl4Lk1d0V.png)\n\nOnce you are successfully done with the above, you can follow the code block below to navigate around your store server, admin, and storefront:\n\n```\n## Medusa API\ncd my-medusa-store/backend\nmedusa develop\n\n## Medusa Store Admin\ncd my-medusa-store/admin\nnpm start\n\n## Medusa Storefront\ncd my-medusa-store/storefront\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n\u003e Note: Each folder (backend, admin, and storefront) has its own Git history.\n\n## Install and Configure Stripe Medusa Plugin in Medusa Backend\n\nThe *Stripe Medusa plugin* will enable Stripe payment to work on this project and also create a channel for your project to communicate with Stripe APIs.\n\nBefore you start, navigate to your `backend` directory using the following command:\n\n```\ncd my-medusa-store/backend\n```\n\nIn the root of your backend, run the following command to install the Stripe plugin:\n\n```\nnpm install medusa-payment-stripe\n```\n\nNext, you need to add  STRIPE API KEY and STRIPE WEBHOOK SECRET to your `.env` file:\n\n```\nSTRIPE_API_KEY=example_API_key_xxxxx\nSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=example_WEBHOOK_key_xxxxx\n```\n\nIn the above, replace `example_API_key_xxxxx` and `example_WEBHOOK_key_xxxxx`  with the keys gotten from your [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys).\n\n\u003e Note: Stripe webhook secret is not necessary to add in development. You can skip it if you wish.\n\nNext, you need to add configurations for your Stripe plugin. In `medusa-config.js`, add the following at the end of the `plugins` array:\n\n```\nconst plugins = [\n  // ...\n  {\n    resolve: `medusa-payment-stripe`,\n    options: {\n      api_key: process.env.STRIPE_API_KEY,\n      webhook_secret: process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET,\n    },\n  },\n]\n```\n\n### Test Medusa Server\n\nIf you’ve completed the above processes, start your store server with the command below:\n\n```\nmedusa develop\n```\n\nYou can navigate to `localhost:9000/store/products/` to see available products in your store.\n\n![](/images/DWhQR57y_V.png)\n\nThe image you see above represents a sample response containing your store products. You should see something similar.\n\n### Enable Stripe Payment Provider in a Region\n\nRegions in Medusa are used to manage the markets where you will operate within. You can manage and add multiple countries in a region. You can also manage shipping options and payment providers.\n\nBefore you start, navigate to your `admin` directory and start your admin using the following command:\n\n```\ncd my-medusa-store/admin\nnpm start\n```\n\nEnsure your *backend server* is still running, then `localhost:7000` on your browser to access your admin page.\n\n![](/images/ACbNh8sdhN.png)\n\nIf you completed the steps above successfully, then you should a page similar to the image above.\n\nMedusa seeded your database with a demo admin that you can log in with. The email is `admin@medusa-test.com`, and the password is `supersecret`.\n\nIf you log in with the demo admin login details, you will have access to your admin dashboard.\n\nThe next step is to add Stripe Payment to your Regions, simply follow the steps below:\n\n1.

You can integrate payment gateways, shipping programs, customer relationship management (CRM) programs, and others.\n*   SEO-Friendly: React is also SEO-friendly, which is crucial for ecommerce websites whose traffic is largely derived from search engines. React's virtual DOM enables quicker rendering times, which can enhance the site's search engine indexing.\n\n## **5 React-Based Tools for Your Ecommerce Stack**\n\n### **Medusa React**\n\n![](/images/Gqa-IcLBQ9.png)\n\n[Medusa React](https://docs.medusajs.com/medusa-react/overview/) is a library that allows developers to build custom React storefronts and React-based frameworks that interact seamlessly with the Medusa backend. It provides a set of components, utilities, and hooks to facilitate this interaction and makes use of the react-query library for server-side state management.\n\nMedusa React is used for [building ecommerce websites or applications](https://medusajs.com/blog/creating-react-native-ecommerce-app-with-medusa/). It uses the Medusa backend for tasks such as managing orders, processing payments, and tracking inventory.\n\n### **Advantages of Using** **Medusa React** **for Ecommerce**\n\n*   Custom Storefronts: By using Medusa React, you can build custom storefronts that are tailored to your specific needs and requirements. This is particularly useful if you have specific requirements or constraints that cannot be met by an off-the-shelf solution. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/commerce) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/@gatsbystorefront/gatsby-theme-storefront-shopify/) are good examples of custom storefronts you can build with Medusa React\n*   Hooks for Fetching Data and Performing Mutations: Medusa React exposes a set of hooks for fetching data (queries) and performing mutations on the server side. These hooks are built on top of react-query's `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks and allow developers to easily access data from the Medusa backend and perform server-side effects.\n*   Server-Side State Management: The library uses `react-query` as a solution for server-side state management, which can help you to manage complex data structures and relationships between different components in your storefront.\n*   Utility Functions for Displaying Localized Money Amounts: Medusa React provides utility functions for converting and displaying money amounts in a localized format. This can be useful for ecommerce applications that need to display prices and other monetary values to users in different regions.\n*   Robust and Well-Supported: Medusa React is a library that is well-maintained and supported by Medusa’s core team. This means that you can count on it to work as expected and receive updates and bug fixes over time. This gives you the confidence to use it in your projects.\n\n### **Next.js**\n\n![](/images/qIq6j0efde.png)\n\n[Next.JS](http://nextjs.org/) is a popular framework for building [server-rendered](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props) React applications; it supports [static-site rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props) and [client-site rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/client-side). It is designed to make it simple for developers to build apps or create react apps that are fast and can be rendered on both the server and the client.\n\nThe complexity of server rendering and code splitting is handled by Next.js, allowing developers to concentrate on creating their applications.\n\n### **Advantages of Using Next.js for Ecommerce**\n\n*   Improved Performance and User Experience: One of the main advantages of using Next.js for ecommerce is its ability to deliver a fast and smooth user experience using server-side rendering. Here, the initial render is done on the server rather than the client, leading to a shorter website load time.\n*   SEO-Friendly: Next.js is both SEO-friendly and easy to use, making it perfect for creating server-rendered React applications. Additionally, its pre-rendering feature helps with SEO as the HTML for the page is generated on the server and sent to the client. This makes it easy for search engines to access and index the content.\n*   Automatic Code Splitting: Next.js has automatic code splitting, which divides the JavaScript bundle into smaller pieces that may be loaded as demanded. This can improve the performance of the site, as the client does not need to download the entire JavaScript bundle upfront.\n*   Serverless Deployment: Next.js makes application deployment to serverless platforms like Vercel, AWS Lambda, or Google Cloud Functions simple. This can be a more affordable option than maintaining their own servers, as they only pay for the resources they use.\n\n### **Stripe Elements**\n\n![](/images/efowlMwOp6.png)\n\n[Stripe Elements](https://stripe.com/en-gb-us/payments/elements) is a set of pre-built UI components that make it easy to add secure and custom payment forms to a website or application. It is built on top of the Stripe API, which allows developers to process payments and manage customer information.\n\nReact and Stripe work great together, and Stripe Elements makes it easy to add payment processing to your website or application.\n\n### **Advantages of Using Stripe Elements for Ecommerce**\n\n*   Secure Payment Processing: Having the ability to accept payments securely is one of the key benefits of using Stripe Elements for ecommerce. Stripe is a well-known, trusted payment gateway with strong security measures in place to protect customer information.\n*   Custom-Made Payment Forms: Using Stripe Elements, payment forms can be customized to match the branding and look of a website or application. It can make the payment process more convenient for customers, which in turn enhances their experience.\n*   Strong Community Support: Since Stripe has an active developer community, Stripe Elements users have access to a variety of information and support. It comes with plugins and frameworks that can be quickly added to React-based ecommerce projects. It also has a robust ecosystem of tools and services.\n\n### **Gatsby**\n\n![](/images/7WOGAZGoVh.png)\n\n[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is a popular open source framework built on react that helps developers build fast, modern websites and applications. Gatsby provides several rendering options.\n\nIt provides a [deferred static generation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/rendering-options/using-deferred-static-generation/), which builds a page the first time a user requests it. It also provides [server-side rendering](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/rendering-options/using-server-side-rendering/) that generates pages on the fly with data fetched each time a user visits the page and static site generation that generates pages at build time.\n\nBy employing a static site generator approach, rather than relying on server-side rendering or client-side rendering, it builds a totally static HTML website at build time. Gatsby websites and apps are fast and efficient because they can be served from a Content Delivery Network without a server.\n\n### **Advantages of Using Gatsby for Ecommerce**\n\n*   Improved Performance and User Experience: Gatsby has the ability to deliver a fast and smooth user experience. Websites and applications can be served from a CDN thanks to Gatsby's static site generator technique, which enables speedy delivery to users wherever they may be.\n*   Easy Integration with Ecommerce Platforms and APIs: With Gatsby, integrating with a variety of ecommerce platforms, tools and APIs is simple, including options like Medusa and Stripe. As a result, developers don't have to worry about creating their own backend or integrating with various payment methods.\n*   SEO-Friendly: Gatsby websites and applications are SEO-friendly due to being built with static HTML and easily crawled by search engines. Gatsby automatically offers drop-in support for server rendering of metadata which is added to the static HTML pages, improving the site's ranking in search engines.\n*   Scalability: Gatsby is a popular tool for ecommerce websites that handle a lot of traffic. It is static, meaning it doesn't need to be updated frequently, and it is cheap to operate. This makes it a great choice for growing companies.\n\n### **Algolia React InstantSearch**\n\n![](/images/AZBhgFeZ8h.png)\n\n[Algolia React InstantSearch](https://www.algolia.com/) is a React library that allows you to quickly build a search interface for your ecommerce website.

What’s the catalyst for this growth? The answer is straightforward: value provision and problem-solving.\n\nEcommerce provides easy access to goods and services, which has helped companies tap into a large customer base who were lacking this service. It may sound simple, but without a functional business infrastructure, you'll quickly lose customers or potential customers and go out of business.\n\nIn this article, you will learn why it's important for your business to have a well-defined ecommerce infrastructure.\n\n## What is Ecommerce?\n\nEcommerce involves buying and selling goods and services online. It can happen between businesses (B2B), between a business and a consumer (B2C), between consumers (C2C), or between a consumer and a business (C2B).\n\nSome examples of ecommerce businesses are Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, and Walmart.\n\n## What is an Infrastructure?\n\nInfrastructures are systems needed by a business to operate smoothly. It is a key component of any business, as it ensures growth and sustainability.\n\nThis could be software such as operating systems, applications, and security tools, as well as hardware, such as servers, routers, etc.\n\nIt also includes the people, procedures, and guidelines that support the infrastructure.\n\n## What are Ecommerce Infrastructures?\n\nEcommerce infrastructures are hardware and software components required to operate and maintain an online store.\n\nThey are the foundation upon which ecommerce businesses are built, empowering businesses to sell their products and services over the internet.\n\nThey include the hardware, software, and services needed to manage online transactions and process orders.\n\n## Components of an Ecommerce Infrastructure\n\nBelow are some infrastructures all ecommerce businesses should have:\n\n### Web Servers\n\nA web server is a hardware or software that stores data and communicates it to users through HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) request. It is in charge of hosting websites, handling visitor requests, and supplying web page content.\n\nWeb servers use scripting languages like PHP, ASP, and JavaScript to generate dynamic web pages.\n\nA web server in ecommerce is a computer that stores and serves web pages to users over the internet. They allow customers to access product information, view prices, and purchase goods.\n\n### Database Servers\n\nA database server is a computer system that stores, manages, and retrieves data from a database. It is the backbone of an ecommerce system, as it hosts the databases used for online transactions and stores customer information.\n\nIt is also in charge of effectively managing the data's organization and security. Database servers also provide expansion, ensuring websites can handle large amounts of data.\n\n### Payment Processing System\n\nA payment processing system is a system used to process financial transactions in an ecommerce system. It lets merchants receive payments from customers, securely process the payments, and transfer the funds to the merchant’s bank account.\n\nThis system is also part of the ecommerce functionality responsible for confirming clients’ identities and providing a secure platform for consumers to make their purchases.\n\nThis handles payments from different sources, such as debit and credit cards, PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.\n\n### Content Delivery Network (CDN)\n\nA content delivery network (CDN) is a network of servers spread out across different locations. It provides online content to users based on their geographic location.\n\nCDNs are used to improve website performance and deliver a better user experience. In ecommerce, CDNs are used to provide online content such as product photos, videos, and other information to customers faster.\n\n### Security and Fraud Prevention\n\nProtecting ecommerce websites from cyber-attacks and fraudulent activities is important. To protect customers, use fraud protection technologies like SEON, Signifyd, Kount, Cybersource, and more.\n\nFor the safety and security of customers and their data, ecommerce security and fraud prevention are crucial.\n\n### Load Balancing\n\nThis is a process for distributing incoming traffic and requests across a group of servers. It helps to improve the performance of an ecommerce system. This gives no room for failure in the system and ensures the system can handle the increased demand from online shoppers.\n\nIt also helps to prevent any server from becoming overloaded with requests and also helps to improve customers' shopping experience.\n\n### Backup System\n\nThis is a system that stores data, such as customer information, routinely. It helps restore the system to the last saved state in the event of a system failure.\n\nThis ensures that the business can quickly and easily recover from any potential data loss. Backup systems can also be used to transfer data from one system to another, allowing for greater flexibility.\n\n### Customer Service\n\nCustomer service in ecommerce is providing support to customers before, during, and after a purchase. This helps customers find what they need, provides shipping and delivery info, and also resolves order issues. This is critical for any ecommerce business.\n\n### Inventory Management\n\nThis is the practice of tracking and controlling the inventory of a business’ product. It includes maintaining stock levels, ordering new products, and tracking sales. It is important to keep accurate records of inventory to ensure customer satisfaction and product availability.\n\nInventory management helps protects against loss due to theft or damage and can help identify areas of opportunity to improve efficiency.\n\n### Shopping Cart\n\nThis is more of an ecommerce feature than a component of an infrastructure. It allows customers to add products to their carts, views their orders, and check out. It is an essential part of any online shopping experience, as it enables customers to quickly and easily purchase products.\n\nItem selection, item quantity adjustments, payment selection, and order submission are common features of cart functionality. This can easily be integrated with the help of ecommerce solutions like Medusa.\n\n### Shipping and Fulfillment\n\nIn ecommerce, shipping and fulfillment refer to the process of receiving, processing, and shipping orders to customers. It also includes shipping tracking and order fulfillment.\n\nShipping and fulfillment are vital for any online business to be successful. This makes sure customers get their orders quickly and are happy with them.\n\nSome examples of providers that offer this service, ShipBob, ShipStation, Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), Deliverr, etc.\n\n## Advantages of a Good Ecommerce Infrastructure\n\n1.  Increased Sales: By providing customers with a better shopping experience, a good ecommerce infrastructure can help to increase sales. Customers will be more likely to complete purchases if they find the process to be smooth and easy.\n2.  Lower Running Costs: A well-designed ecommerce infrastructure can help to reduce running costs. By improving the buying process, businesses can save time and money processing orders and satisfying client requirements.\n3.  Improved Security: A good ecommerce infrastructure can help to ensure the security of customer data and transactions. By investing in strong security measures, businesses can protect their customers’ information and help to prevent fraud.\n4.  Greater Flexibility: A good ecommerce infrastructure can assist organizations in scaling their operations as they grow. Businesses should ensure they are well-prepared for future expansion by investing in infrastructure that can manage greater traffic and revenue.\n\n## Using Medusa as an Ecommerce Platform\n\n[Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) is an open source ecommerce platform. Its composable architecture is made of 3 main components: the headless server, the storefront, and the admin.\n\nTraditional monolithic architecture can be limiting in terms of what can be added or integrated into the infrastructure.\n\nMedusa’s architecture is a key advantage for an ecommerce infrastructure. Its abstract layers give businesses and developers the flexibility to decide what are the best components to use in their infrastructure.\n\nBusinesses can utilize the best-in-line tools and services in their infrastructure to build a scalable platform with essential ecommerce features.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEcommerce infrastructure encompasses a wide range of systems and technologies that work together to support online businesses. These include web services, database servers, payment processing systems, and more.\n\nThese technologies are essential for enabling businesses to operate smoothly and effectively in the digital world. By investing in robust ecommerce infrastructure, businesses can improve their operations, increase their efficiency, and better serve their customers.\n\n\u003e Should you have any issues or questions related to Medusa, then feel free to reach out to the Medusa team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp).\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/importance-of-optimizing-internal-search-in-ecommerce-websites.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/importance-of-optimizing-internal-search-in-ecommerce-websites.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/importance-of-optimizing-internal-search-in-ecommerce-websites.md"},"title":"Importance of Optimizing Internal Search in Ecommerce Websites","date":"2023-02-02","excerpt":"Improve your ecommerce website's internal engine and enhance  customer experience by optimizing your search engine.","theme":"white","type":"PostLayout","authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-eb2no2kx3.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-eb2no2kx3.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-eb2no2kx3.json"},"firstName":"Shahed ","lastName":"Nasser","role":"Role","image":{"url":"/images/27354907.jpeg","altText":"Person photo"},"type":"Person"}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-a9wemp4po.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json"},"name":"Other","type":"Category"},"featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/internal-search-min.jpg","altText":"Importance of Optimizing Internal Search in Ecommerce Websites","caption":"Caption of the image","elementId":""},"seo_description":"Improve your ecommerce website's internal engine and enhance customer experience by optimizing your search engine.","seo_keywords":"search engine optimization, ecommerce","markdown_content":"While the value of external search optimization (SEO) is widely known, many ecommerce websites overlook the value of the hidden gem that is internal search engines. [Only 15% of businesses](https://neilpatel.com/blog/site-search-killing-your-conversion/) dedicate resources into perfecting the site search. This is worrying as [68% of customers](https://www.forrester.com/report/Googleize+Your+SiteSearch+Experience/-/E-RES124541) do not return to an ecommerce website that provided a bad search experience.\n\nWhen building an internal search engine, businesses should provide a search experience that matches their products and audience. This requires configuring your search engine’s ranking rules, synonyms, faceted search, and more.\n\nWhen we designed our Search APIs at [Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa), we abstracted the search functionalities to allow developers and businesses to either implement custom logic, or, more commonly, use search services like [MeiliSearch](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/meilisearch) or [Algolia](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/algolia). These services continuously optimize their search functionalities to ensure that your ecommerce website provides a good search experience.\n\nThis article explains some tips for configuring and optimizing your search engine to provide a better search experience for your customers.\n\n\u003e **What is Medusa?** [Medusa](https://medusajs.com/) provides bespoke, modular and open commerce infrastructure for developers. Medusa’s different components and APIs are built in abstract layers, making it easier for developers to customize the core functionalities for different business use cases.\n\n## Some Search Statistics\n\nIf you’re unsure of the importance of internal search engines, here are some statistics that emphasize their effect on ecommerce sales:\n\n*   [43% of customers](https://www.forrester.com/report/MustHave+eCommerce+Features/-/E-RES89561) on retail ecommerce websites go straight to the internal search engine.\n*   Internal search engines are widely used by the most valuable customers; customers that use the internal search engine are [2.4 times more likely to make a purchase](https://resources.algolia.com/ecommerce/40-stats-on-e-commerce-search-and-kpis).\n*   Customers that use the internal search engine [spend 2.6 more times than those who don’t search](https://resources.algolia.com/ecommerce/40-stats-on-e-commerce-search-and-kpis).\n*   [39% of customers](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/micro-moments/meet-needs-i-want-to-buy-moments/) are influenced to make purchase by relevant search results.\n\n## Tips to Optimize Internal Search Engines\n\n### Ranking Rules\n\nRanking rules are used to decide which search result shows first. A basic approach would show the results having the same exact words in the name of the product first. Although this is fine, but in a lot of cases you must take into account other attributes such as the category of the product or its stock amount.\n\nYou might also want to boost the ranking of some products over others due to a marketing strategy. For example, you might want to show products having a discount higher than those without a discount.\n\nDefining your ranking rules can help customers find exactly what they need and influence them to make a purchase.\n\n### **Typo Tolerance**\n\nCustomers often make typos while searching. If a search engine shows them results based on their exact query, they’ll typically land on no results pages, which leads them to making no purchase.\n\nAn internal search engine must be optimized to detect and resolve typos, providing the customer with the results they’re looking for. Most search engine services utilize machine learning to ensure typo tolerance and provide a better search experience.\n\n### Search Analytics\n\nSearch analytics can be a minefield of valuable information about your customers. It can help you understand what are the most searched for items. Coupled with other analytics you have related to purchases, you can figure out which of these items result from search results and, in turn, boost their ranking.\n\nSearch analytics can also help you figure out which queries lead to no search results. This can be useful to understand what type of products your customers are looking for in your ecommerce website. You can also utilize this to define related results for these search queries.\n\n### Synonyms\n\nOften, multiple words have a similar meaning. For example, some customers might use “shirt” and “t-shirt” interchangeably. This can also be affected by different customer cultures or locations.\n\nA good search engine should provide synonyms that would allow the customers to land on the same search results, despite which synonym they use. Obviously, it would be difficult to cater to every possible synonym. You can utilize here the search analytics mentioned earlier to figure out what synonyms are necessary to define.\n\n### Parsing Search Queries\n\nAccording to [Google’s 2022 Year in Review](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/trending-visual-stories/2022-year-in-search/), there’s a +75% year-on-year (YOY) increase in search queries related to saving money, such as “cheap electric cars”. Some customers might use other search queries, such as “shirts under $20”.\n\nAlthough it might not be highly necessary to account for these search queries, parsing them and showing the customer exactly what they need can show customers that you understand them. Consequently, it can lead to a better search experience.\n\n### Faceted Search\n\nFaceted search enables users to narrow down their search queries by providing filters that allow them to be more specific.\n\nFor instance, by using this search feature, someone looking for a Batman shirt can filter out books and videos about the superhero and focus the search on the desired product.\n\nFilters can be as basic as showing different available categories, and can extend to adding more advanced choices such as material, brand, colors, sizes, and more.\n\n### A/B Testing\n\nA/B testing is the process of comparing the outcome or analytics two different versions of a feature or interfaces. In the context of internal search engines, A/B testing can be used to figure out which configurations drive more sales.\n\nFor example, if you have two ranking rules, and you’re unsure which one would be better for your customers, you can use A/B testing to figure that out.\n\nThere are many ways to run A/B testing. Algolia provides [steps to run an A/B test for search relevance](https://resources.algolia.com/a-b-testing/5-ways-to-a-b-test-your-search-for-relevance). Search services may provide this functionality differently.\n\n### Optimized No-Results Page\n\nDespite all the configurations and optimizations you may put in place to improve your internal search engine, it’s still inevitable that the customer might land on a no-results page. Instead of trying to avoid the reality of a no-results page, you can embrace and utilize it for other opportunities.\n\nA no-results page can be optimized to include the following:\n\n*   Recommended results: You can show results for a collection of products that drive sales. For example, discounted products or best-selling products.\n*   Suggested queries: You can show queries that are similar to the customer’s query, or queries you’re sure will provide many results.\n*   Personalized suggestions: You can use analytics related to the customer to provide suggestions. For example, you can show results based on the customer’s previous search results. You can also show results that are popular in the customer’s region or location.\n\n## Search Metrics to Measure\n\nSearch metrics and analytics can be key in optimizing your internal search engine. They can help you better understand your customer and decide on new configurations if necessary.\n\nSome search metrics that you should measure are:\n\n*   **Most Searched Products:** this metric can help you understand what your customers look for the most in your website. It can be an opportunity to find new products for your store.\n*   **Searched Products Leading to Highest Conversions:** just because a product is searched for the most does not mean it’s the product that leads to conversion and revenue. Combining the Most Searched Products metric with the Conversion metric can be useful to decide on ranking rules.\n*   **New Searches:** new searches wouldn’t rank high in the Most Searched Products metric, but they can provide useful insights to the new and upcoming trends in your industry.\n*   **No Result Searches:** this metric shows which search queries lead to no-result pages. This can be used to define synonyms or search suggestions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOptimizing your internal search engine can be a powerful tool to improve your ecommerce sales. By carefully configuring your ranking rules, typo tolerance, synonyms, faceted search, and parsing search queries, you can provide a better search experience for your customers.\n\nAdditionally, by measuring search metrics such as Most Searched Products, Searched Products Leading to Highest Conversions, New Searches, and No Result Searches, you can better understand your customer’s needs and optimize your search engine accordingly.\n\nBy implementing these tips, you can be sure of providing an improved internal search engine experience for your customers.\n\nMedusa is a composable commerce engine that allows you to integrate whichever search engine you find most suitable for you.

I was entirely wrong.\n\nMany shops seem to have neglected to put energy into product categorization altogether, which is quite alarming given that this is the first main navigation mechanism for many B2B sites aside from their search bars.\n\nYet, after studying the setup of more than 500 B2B ecommerce sites as part of our B2B launch at [Medusa](https://medusajs.com/b2b-commerce-platform/), I did recognize a pattern of best (and worst) practices when working with product categorization in B2B ecommerce.\n\nBelow is my recollection shared in 5 simple ways the best B2B companies approach product categorization:\n\n*   **#1 - MECE sub-categories**: Product sub-categories should be Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive.\n*   **#2 - Rule of three:** Have at maximum three layers of product categories showcased on your site (especially in the dropdown navigation).\n*   **#3 -** **Three seconds to comprehend**: Systemize and structure your categories in a way that takes less than 3 seconds to comprehend.\n*   **#4 - KISS navigation:** When your catalog is large and diverse, keep the navigation simple and clean with to-the-point category names.\n*   **#5 - Cross-categories with purpose:** Use cross-categories when you purposefully want to emphasize a trait across many categories\n\n\u003e ***What is Medusa?*** [***Medusa***](https://medusajs.com/) *provides bespoke, modular and open commerce infrastructure for developers. If you want to build nested product categories with Medusa, stay tuned for our next Product Releases.* [*Read more*](https://medusajs.com/blog/our-2023-roadmap/)*.* \n\n## What is a product category?\n\nLet us quickly define a product category. By Product Category, I refer to **a group of similar products that share related characteristics.** The category label sums up the product underneath it.\n\nFor example, the category of **Car tires** could contain both winter and summer tires in different sizes. Tires could also be a sub-category of a larger category referring to **Cars** of a car manufacturer shop.\n\n## The good, the bad, and the product-category-mesh\n\nThe way that most B2B pages choose to categorize products can best be described as a product-category-mesh.\n\nMany shops, take the first step of bundling their products into categories (Hurrah!). But from that point on they just bundle it all together in one big mesh, leaving it to the customer to navigate their way through the assortment.\n\nSometimes I saw this leading to the creation of +1,000 categories with no clear linkages that made it easy for the customer to navigate unless using the search function.\n\nIn many instances, this random bundling led to category overlaps, making it unclear for users where and how to start.\n\nTake the example below from a tool manufacturer and try to figure out for yourself whether the *electrical saw* was stashed under **Electrical**, **Power Tools**, **Hand Tools**, **Cutting** **Tools** or **Machinery**.\n\n![](/images/YXTVuSdJ_Q.png)\n\nIf this is the worst practice, let us see how some companies managed to turn this for the better.\n\n## 5 Rules for Best Product Categorization\n\n### #1 - MECE sub-categories\n\nThe above example quickly becomes a problem for B2B shops that have large and complex product catalogs with several thousand products.\n\nOne effective way some ecommerce sites avoided the mesh was to bundle all categories into main, sub, and sub-sub-… categories.\n\nThese categories must be [**MECE**](https://blog.felix-seifert.com/structure-with-mece-principle/) (**M**utually **E**xclusive, **C**ollectively **E**xhaustive). Meaning that categories cannot overlap (mutually exclusive) while they still have to cover the full product assortment (collectively exhaustive). See example below.\n\n![](/images/5qlu23pK71.png)\n\n[**Indiamart**](https://my.indiamart.com/) applies this type of segmentation to its product assortment. Despite an assortment of several million products, they still manage to make it easily digestible by breaking it down into six distinguishable **business areas** (Building \u0026 Construction, Electronics \u0026 Electrical, Drugs \u0026 Pharma etc…).\n\nBeneath that, they further segment each business area into high-level **product categories** (e.g. Solar \u0026 Renewable Energy Products, Office Automation Products \u0026 Devices) and then further down into individual **product categories** (e.g. Solar Panels and Water Pumps).\n\n![](/images/l-_R144EEM.png)\n\n### #2 - Rule of 3\n\nWhen trying to make this type of product (sub-)categorization, the golden rule seems to be **3**. For the vast majority of shops that applied the sub-categorization, they had at maximum 3 category layers; one main category with up to two levels below.\n\nSee an example below from [Morgan Sports](https://www.morgansports.com.au/) (supplier of fitness equipment) which has 8 main categories with two layers underneath. For instance, **Functional Fitness \u003e Strength Equipment \u003e Dumbbell Sets \u0026 Dumbbell Racks**.\n\n![](/images/G-J6BSLPZW.png)\n\nThe 3-layer-categorization rule does not always apply when moving deeper into the product grid, but rarely will you see more than 3 layers upfront in the dropdown navigation.\n\nWhen you want customers to dig deeper into a category with thousands of products, it can be useful to start using more advanced product filtering, which can make it extremely easy to navigate a larger product assortment.\n\nA good example of this can be seen below from [Blake Envelopes](https://www.blake-envelopes.com/), which breaks down its product categories in easy-to-navigate filtering whenever customers enter the product grid. Read more about their advanced product filtering processes, [here](https://medusajs.com/blog/top-5-b2b-ecommerce-sites-blake/).\n\n![](/images/yYjmXKiLIX.png)\n\n### #3 - 3 seconds to comprehend\n\nAnother problem encountered with many of the categorizations was simply that the categorization was too complex to decode easily. This puts the B2B customer in a position, where the person has to spend a lot of time comprehending how to navigate the assortment in the first place.\n\nBelow is one example of a dropdown without any meaningful logic to it, which leaves the customer questioning which direction to move.\n\n![](/images/09DC7Xm21F.png)\n\nIdeally, a product categorization should be easy to comprehend within 3 seconds. This is all about systemizing the categorization in a meaningful way based on attributes like:\n\n*   Product types\n*   Application areas\n*   Format and sizes\n*   Customer types\n*   etc...\n\nA prime example of this in a B2B context comes again from [Blake Envelopes](https://www.blake-envelopes.com/). They break down their assortment into multiple categories at once (e.g. envelope size, color, type etc...) for the customer to easily find the system most meaningful to their own situation. They also combine it with a lot of visual elements to make the categorization very easy to decode even from a quick look at it.\n\n![](/images/N0YsI2suQj.png)\n\n### #4 - KISS navigation\n\nGranted, Blake Envelopes benefits from its product simplicity (envelopes), and not all B2B brands share that luxury.\n\nHowever, some stores managed to still make their product categories easy to navigate despite large and complex catalogs. The secret? The [**K**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/keep-it-simple-stupid-how-to-use-the-kiss-principle-in-design/)[eep ](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/keep-it-simple-stupid-how-to-use-the-kiss-principle-in-design/)[**I**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/keep-it-simple-stupid-how-to-use-the-kiss-principle-in-design/)[t ](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/keep-it-simple-stupid-how-to-use-the-kiss-principle-in-design/)[**S**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/keep-it-simple-stupid-how-to-use-the-kiss-principle-in-design/)[imple ](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/keep-it-simple-stupid-how-to-use-the-kiss-principle-in-design/)[**S**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/keep-it-simple-stupid-how-to-use-the-kiss-principle-in-design/)[tupid (KISS) principle](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/keep-it-simple-stupid-how-to-use-the-kiss-principle-in-design/) was applied throughout their assortment.\n\nTheir product catalogs most often were based on product types, with simple alphabetical orders to systemize sub-categories. No fancy titles, no overly visual designs or anything similar.\n\nBelow is an example from [Alibaba.com](http://Alibaba.com) showcasing a very lean and simple setup despite guarding several thousand products underneath each sub-category.\n\n![](/images/X1rcDYTZ5W.png)\n\nNotice, as well, that even the world's largest B2B commerce sites stick to only 3 layers of product categories in their category dropdowns (the same goes for other large B2B sites such as Amazon and Eworldtrade).\n\nDoes KISS mean you cannot spice up your categorization when having a large B2B product catalog? Absolutely not. Below are a few examples of how some B2B ships add creativity to the categorization via cross-categories.\n\n### #5 - Cross-categories with purpose\n\nAlthough the MECE principle applies to the overall categorization, there are a few examples of categories that can be used to collect products across different category types\n\nThe three most common types of categories are:\n\n*   **Most popular:** Guided by total sales (in $) or number of items sold.\n*   **Discounts:** Often just filtering all discounted products across the site. In some instances, only selected products are displayed here to bring special attention to products the shop wants to get rid of quickly.\n*   **New arrivals:** This category was used not only in seasonal shops (e.g. fashion and beauty) but also in more traditional B2B product sites where B2B purchasers might be looking primarily to stay updated on new additions to the catalog.\n\nWhether the above cross-categories make sense obviously depends on the business type and the type of B2B customers expected. In all regards, these methods are great to use when you have a specific target to optimize for. For example, you can use this method to bring attention to your newest collection, clearing inventory with discounts, or similar.\n\nAside from the above more traditional cross-categories, I also experienced a few more “exotic” cross-categories in a few stores. Namely:\n\n*   **Delivery time:** An interesting cross-category was Delivery Time (found in [DHgate](https://www.dhgate.com/)). This one caters to the need for quick delivery, which is more associated with B2C-styled shops. In some instances, this category might prove useful when quick replenishment and/or assortment replacement is needed.\n*   **Trending searches:** Some of the largest B2B shops had this category included (for example, [Snapdeal](https://www.snapdeal.com/) and [Made-in-China.com](http://Made-in-China.com)) to improve customer navigation. One of the more nuanced variations of it comes from [ec21](https://www.ec21.com/), which almost treats Top Searching Keywords as a subcategory of its own (see below).\n\n![](/images/9uwL1ZfHoV.png)\n\nSimilar to the other cross-categories, these can be highly beneficial when you purposefully emphasize a trait across many categories, e.g. highlighting delivery time as a strength or hinting customers to top queries.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nToo many B2B companies today do not focus enough on their ecommerce product categorization, despite it being one of the primary ways of site navigation.\n\nBelow are 5 simple rules that I learned that made some B2B ecommerce sites stand out on product categorization:\n\n*   **#1 - MECE sub-categories**: Product sub-categories should be Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive.\n*   **#2 - Rule of three:** Have at maximum three layers of product categories showcased on your site (especially in the dropdown navigation).\n*   **#3 -** **Three seconds to comprehend**: Systemize and structure your categories in a way that takes less than 3 seconds to comprehend.\n*   **#4 - KISS navigation:** When your catalog is large and diverse, keep the navigation simple with to-the-point category names and less distracting visuals.\n*   **#5 - Cross-categories with purpose:** Use cross-categories when you purposefully want to emphasize a trait across many categories\n\nFor more articles on how to build a great B2B ecommerce experience, check out our articles on:\n\n*   [**9 Best Ecommerce UX Practices From the World's Best Ecommerce Site**](https://medusajs.com/blog/9-best-ecommerce-ux-practices-with-examples/)\n*   [**5 B2B Ecommerce Sites to Learn UX Design**](https://medusajs.com/blog/5-b2b-ecommerce-sites-to-learn-ux-design/)\n*   [**Best open source ecommerce platforms for B2B: A feature-by-feature review**](https://medusajs.com/blog/top-5-open-source-ecommerce-platforms/)\n*   [**Medusa B2B: How to set Up B2B Store**](https://medusajs.com/blog/medusa-b2b-part-1/)\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/git-inspired-order-editing-feature.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/git-inspired-order-editing-feature.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/git-inspired-order-editing-feature.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"How we built Order Editing","date":"2023-01-25","excerpt":"This article covers how we adopted principles from the Git version control system and GitHub in our Order Editing API design.","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/order-edit.jpg","altText":"Inspired by Git: How we Designed our Order-Editing Feature","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","theme":"white","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json"},"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Juhl","role":"CTO \u0026 Co-founder","image":{"url":"/images/oli.jpeg","altText":"Oliver Juhl"},"type":"Person","bio":"CTO \u0026 Co-founder of Medusa\n"}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json"},"name":"Product","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"[Medusa’s](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) Order API supports order editing capabilities that equip merchants and developers with the tooling necessary to reduce manual work and offer a great customer experience.\n\nDesigning this seemingly simple functionality proved to be a complex task that was solved with inspiration from the world's most-used developer tools.\n\nThis article covers how we adopted principles from the Git version control system and GitHub in our Order Editing API design. You can read the product announcement [here](https://medusajs.com/blog/order-edits-announcement/).\n\n## Understanding Order Editing\n\nBefore going over the design behind this feature, we need to understand its constraints. Let’s dive into what it means to edit an order in Medusa.\n\nWhen an order is placed, it is in its base state from a customer and store administrator point of view. Generally, the next steps for orders from here are fulfillment, shipping, and payment capturing.\n\nSometimes a change in the order might be required first. Several scenarios could lead to this; the customer changed their mind about their purchase, the inventory management system was out of sync with the physical stock, or the merchant wants to add a complimentary item due to long processing time.\n\nA naive solution would allow store administrators to modify order items directly. However, this could have serious consequences. Order history is lost or becomes misleading, potential unresolved payment discrepancies arise, and stale order data remain in integrated services, such as analytics providers.\n\nAside from ensuring data consistency in your underlying dependencies, you also want to offer a good customer experience. Instead of changing things directly, you want to give customers full control and confidence by allowing them to confirm a change before it is completed. Supporting these cases spawns the need to introduce an intermediate pending step for the edits you make to an order.\n\nIt should be clear that editing an order is not as straightforward as updating the quantity of a line item. There are many use cases and dependencies to consider to ensure data is consistent across all systems in your stack and that customers get the best experience.\n\n## Building an API with git-like flow of events\n\nAs we started to plan the feature, it became apparent that we were building a subset of the functionality from a version control system with a pull request-like mechanism for editing an order.\n\nThe goal was to allow users to change the original state of their order with an approval-staged flow without losing its history. A Git-like system with the management capabilities offered by GitHub.\n\nWe were excited to realize that a developer-centric pattern from our daily work could directly apply to our API design.\n\nWe can see the following resemblance between the order-editing flow and a git-like system:\n\n*   Order placed → Main branch\n*   Store administrator initiates an order edit → Branches out from main\n*   Store administrator makes changes to order edit → Pushes commits to branch\n*   Store administrator submits an order edit → Opens a pull request to main\n*   Customer confirms an order edit → Reviewer approves the pull request\n\nWe even extended the capabilities of the API with additional functionality as a result of using the Git + GitHub analogy:\n\n*   Store administrator force completes an order edit → Core maintainer force merges a pull request\n*   Customer requests an additional item → Reviewer requests changes to the pull request\n\nOur feature had a functional requirement of having an intermediate step between initializing the edit and committing the changes. In this state, you can create multiple edits to the order without applying them. This is similar to pushing commits to a branch while a feature is in work-in-progress, except we only allow one commit for each order edit. More on that later.\n\n### Design\n\nNow let’s turn to implementation specifics to see how the analogy took shape in our data layer.\n\nThere are two database models worth highlighting: `OrderEdit` and `OrderItemChange`:\n\n```ts\n// order-edit.ts\n\nOrderEdit\n- id\n- order\n- changes\n- internal_note\n- items\n\n// order-item-change.ts\n\nOrderItemChange\n- id\n- original_line_item\n- line_item\n- type (add, remove, update)\n```\n\nOnly properties relevant to the Git analogy are included above. If you wish to explore the models more in-depth, you can find them [here](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/entities/classes/OrderEdit).\n\nThe `OrderEdit` model holds the modifications you want to make to your order. It references the original order, stores an internal note, and contains a list of edits. When an `OrderEdit` is created, all items from the Order are copied to the `OrderEdit`.\n\nThe edits are represented as one or more `OrderItemChange` records. There are three types of changes: Add, Remove and Update. The purpose of each should be clear. When an edit is created, we store a copy of the original item to ensure full visibility of the history when these changes are eventually applied.\n\nYou might have already drawn the parallels to Git. The above data modeling is comparable to how branches, staged changes, and commits work. The `OrderEdit` is your branch diverging from the main one, and the `OrderItemChange` records are your staged changes ready to be pushed.\n\nTogether, they constitute the commit with a message and hold the information capable of showing a diff of the changes.\n\n### Limitations to the analogy\n\nNot all aspects of a traditional version control system apply to our feature. Whereas Git is excellent at facilitating seamless collaboration among an indefinite number of users, our feature is limited to one active order edit at a time. Only one branch aside from the main one.\n\nThis is to guard businesses against unwanted situations arising from multiple ongoing edits and outbound payment links. An example would be that customers accidentally pay for the wrong order edit. We built the logic to eliminate potential merge conflicts.\n\nAnd finally, we don’t offer a way for merchants to roll back the changes when first committed. The changes made to an Order are irreversible. No `git revert`.\n\n## Demo\n\nEnough talking. Let’s see it in action.\n\n\u003cvideo width=\"700\" height=\"504\" controls preload=\"none\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; object-fit: cover;\" poster=\"/images/order-editing-poster.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/order-editing.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDesigning our Order Editing API was especially exciting, as it allowed us to apply existing concepts from our daily work to solve a problem for our users. The API we built provides a great developer experience by using familiar concepts while abstracting away the complexity for our merchants in the admin system.\n\nFor concrete API examples of the full order editing flow, see our how-to documentations on:\n\n*   [Edit an order as an administrator](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/entities/classes/OrderEdit)\n*   [Implement order-editing on the storefront](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/storefront/handle-order-edits)\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/order-edits-announcement.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/order-edits-announcement.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/order-edits-announcement.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Order Edits and Payment Collections are now available","date":"2023-01-25","excerpt":"Learn more about Medusa’s new order-editing feature and how it works","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/order-edit-announcement-min.jpg","altText":"Order Edits and Payment Collections are now available","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","theme":"white","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-x7i0ls6ji.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-x7i0ls6ji.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-x7i0ls6ji.json"},"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Rindom","image":{"url":"/images/Seb.jpeg","altText":"Person photo"},"type":"Person"}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json"},"name":"Product","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"[Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) is happy to announce Order Editing and Payment Collections as the latest additions to the Order API, strengthening one of the most critical parts of any commerce application. This is an essential step in our mission to deliver commerce building blocks that developers can use to create bespoke digital commerce experiences without reinventing core commerce functionality.\n\nThe Order Editing and Payment Collection features solve the problems faced when businesses need to change already placed orders. Systems that rely on order data, like fulfillment and accounting systems, will have to be updated, and payment discrepancies may arise. These updates and discrepancies often require error-prone, manual work.\n\nMedusa’s new capabilities offer a simple and worry-free approach to creating order edits while giving your customers the best experience.\n\n## How Order Editing Works\n\nThe Order Edit flow consists of three simple steps:\n\n1.  Select the changes you wish to make.\n2.  Ask the customer to confirm your changes or, as an admin, force a confirmation.\n3.  See the order edit merged into the order and continue managing your order as usual.\n\n\u003cvideo width=\"700\" height=\"504\" controls preload=\"none\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; object-fit: cover;\" poster=\"/images/order-editing-poster.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/order-editing.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\nEditing orders in Medusa allows you to update, add and remove line items on already placed orders with a few easy steps.\n\nHelpful timeline events ensure that you and your team have visibility to understand the order’s history and assist customers with questions about their orders.\n\nTo learn more about how we designed Medusa’s order editing capabilities, check out [this article that dives deeper into the solution](/blog/git-inspired-order-editing-feature/).\n\n### Give your customers confidence and peace of mind\n\nThe confirmation step is essential to the order editing flow and ensures that your customer is always in the loop about changes to their order. You can configure notifications that automatically inform customers that they must accept changes to their orders.\n\nThey can confirm their changes with simple steps and pay for potential shipping and total differences.\n\n\u003cvideo width=\"700\" height=\"504\" controls preload=\"none\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; object-fit: cover;\" poster=\"/images/payment-collection-poster.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/payment-collection.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\nCustomers can accept order edits to stay in the loop about changes to their order and pay for potential differences.\n\nFor businesses, Medusa’s extensible API also provides a new opportunity to upsell customers and highlight products.\n\n## New possibilities with great APIs\n\nEverything we build at Medusa is deliberately designed to give a robust starting point while remaining open for customizations and extensions that can make Medusa truly your own. This is also the case for Order Editing and Payment Collections, where plugins and projects can now listen to a comprehensive set of new events that can act as triggers for automations and integrations.\n\nAccounting and fulfillment plugins, for example, will be able to listen for changes to orders and update systems to ensure consistency throughout your stack. This eliminates manual work while giving your customers a fast and smooth experience.\n\n```\n// src/subscribers/my-subscriber.ts\n\neventBus.subscribe(OrderEditService.REQUESTED, async ({ id }) =\u003e {\n  const analyticsData = await getTrackingData(id)\n  analyticsProvider.track(\"Order Edit Requested\", analyticsData)\n})\n```\n\nFinally, our Payment Collection API will soon expand to support broader use cases like re-authorizing expired payment authorizations and creating new payment experiences for your customers, like installments or deposit payments.\n\n## Try it out now\n\nWe are excited to see what unique new experiences and plugins will be built with the new Order Editing and Payment Collection capabilities.\n\nTry it out now by upgrading to the latest version of Medusa:\n\n```\nyarn add @medusajs/medusa@latest\n```\n\nOr start a new project:\n\n```\nyarn create medusa-app\n```\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about this feature, check out [this article](/blog/git-inspired-order-editing-feature/) which goes over how Git and GitHub inspired the design of the Order Editing capabilities.\n\nYou can also learn more about order editing in our documentation:\n\n*   [How to implement order editing functionalities for administrators](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/admin/order-edit)\n*   [How to implement order editing functionalities in a storefront](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/storefront/handle-order-edits)\n*   OrderEdit [Admin](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin/#tag/OrderEdit) and [Store](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store/#tag/OrderEdit) API reference\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/chatgpt-medusa.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/chatgpt-medusa.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/chatgpt-medusa.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Use ChatGPT to Automate Product Description Writing","date":"2023-01-19","excerpt":"Never think about product descriptions.

Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\nIn today's fast-paced ecommerce world, it's more important than ever to have compelling product descriptions that clearly and accurately convey the value of your offerings. However, crafting effective descriptions can be time-consuming, especially if you have a large catalog of products. This is where [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) comes in.\n\nWith ChatGPT, you can easily automate the writing of your product descriptions, saving you time and effort while still delivering top-notch content to your customers. What if I told you that the previous paragraph was written by ChatGPT? Did you see how ChatGPT generated human-like text that is indistinguishable?\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to use ChatGPT to automate writing your product descriptions in [Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa). Medusa is a [composable ecommerce](https://medusajs.com/blog/composable-commerce/) platform that can be integrated with any third-party services, including ChatGPT.\n\nYou can find the code for the tutorial in [this repository](https://github.com/ashutoshkrris/How-to-Use-ChatGPT-to-Automate-Writing-your-Product-Description).\n\nHere’s a demo of the end result.\n\n![](/images/medusa-chatgpt-2462f90e.gif)\n\n## What is Medusa?\n\n[Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) is an open source [composable](https://medusajs.com/blog/composable-commerce/) commerce engine for developers who want to take ownership of their ecommerce stack. The platform is highly extensible and easy to customize which has made it the #1 JavaScript Ecommerce Platform on Github in record time with 16K+ stars.\n\nMedusa is composed of three components: the headless backend, the admin dashboard, and the [storefront](https://medusajs.com/blog/next-js-storefront-food-ecommerce-restaurant-medusa-paystack/). You can set up an entire ecommerce store within minutes by running just a couple of commands.\n\nSince Medusa is highly extensible, it allows developers to build custom features or integrate third-party services such as ChatGPT into Medusa very easily. You can learn more about the official and community plugins [here](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/plugins/overview/).\n\n## What is ChatGPT?\n\n[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) has developed a revolutionary long-form question-answering AI called ChatGPT; it is capable of answering complex questions conversationally. This technology is groundbreaking because it has been trained to understand the intended meaning behind human questions.\n\nChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a powerful AI tool that leverages the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 family of large language models. It has been fine-tuned using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques to deliver optimal performance.\n\n### Different Models Offered by GPT-3\n\nThe [GPT-3 language models](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3) have the ability to understand and generate natural language. Four main language models are available, each with varying levels of power and capabilities to suit different tasks.\n\n*   `text-davinci-003`: It is the most advanced and capable language model in the GPT-3 family. It is capable of completing any task that the other models can perform, often with higher quality, longer output, and better ability to follow instructions. Additionally, it has the ability to insert completions within the text\n*   `text-curie-001`: It is highly capable, but faster and more cost-effective than Davinci.\n*   `text-babbage-001`: It can complete straightforward tasks efficiently and at a lower cost compared to other models.\n*   `text-ada-001`: It is capable of performing simple tasks quickly and at a low cost. It is typically the fastest model in the GPT-3 family.\n\nOut of the above four, you’ll use the `text-davinci-003` for text completion in this tutorial as it yields the best results.\n\n## Getting Your OpenAI API Key\n\nOpenAI provides different APIs to interact with its AI models. It provides you free credit worth $18 to experiment for the first three months.\n\nFollow the steps below to get your free OpenAI API key:\n\n1.  Go to [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/) and sign up for a free account. Follow the instructions, and you’ll be redirected to the API Dashboard.\n\n2.  Click on your profile picture to view the menu bar, and then click on *View API Keys* to go to the *API Keys* page.\n\n    ![](/images/Screenshot_2023-01-02_141710.png)\n\n3.  Click on *Create new secret key* to create a new API Key.\n\n    ![](/images/Screenshot_2023-01-02_141730.png)\n\n4.  Copy the API Key and store it safely to use later in the tutorial.\n\n    ![](/images/Screenshot_2023-01-02_141752.png)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore you get started with the tutorial, you should have installed:\n\n*   [Node.js(V14 or later)](https://docs.medusajs.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment#nodejs)\n*   [Git](https://docs.medusajs.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment/#git)\n*   [Medusa CLI](https://docs.medusajs.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment#medusa-cli)\n*   [Redis](https://docs.medusajs.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment/#redis)\n\n## Setting up Your Medusa Development Environment\n\nIn this section, you’ll create a Medusa server where you’ll integrate ChatGPT in the next step.\n\n### Setting up Your Medusa Server\n\nCreate a new Medusa store called `my-medusa-store` and seed the test data using the following command:\n\n```\nmedusa new my-medusa-store --seed\n```\n\nStart your Medusa server using the following command:\n\n```\ncd my-medusa-store\nmedusa develop\n```\n\nThe above two steps take a couple of minutes to set up and run your server on port 9000. You can test your server by going to `http://localhost:9000/store/products` on your browser or by running the following command:\n\n```\ncurl localhost:9000/store/products\n```\n\nIf you get a list of products, your server is successfully set up.\n\n## Create a Subscriber to Handle Empty Descriptions\n\nIn this section, you’ll create a subscriber in your Medusa server that will listen to the `product.created` event. The subscriber then calls a function to handle the description field of the product. If the description field is empty, another function will be called to interact with ChatGPT’s `text-davinci-003` language model.\n\nWhile you can directly interact with the models using their APIs, OpenAI also provides you with several [official](https://beta.openai.com/docs/libraries/libraries) and [community libraries](https://beta.openai.com/docs/libraries/community-libraries) for different languages.\n\nInstall the official OpenAI library in your Medusa server:\n\n```\nnpm install openai\n```\n\nAdd the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the `.env` file in your Medusa server:\n\n```\nOPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here\n```\n\n\u003e Note: Replace the value of `your-api-key-here` with a valid API key that you obtained from OpenAI earlier in the tutorial.\n\nSince you’re going to create a subscriber in your Medusa server, make sure you enable Redis in the `medusa-config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  projectConfig: {\n    redis_url: REDIS_URL, // Enable Redis Here\n\t\t//...\n  },\n  plugins,\n};\n```\n\nCreate a `description.js` file inside `src/subscribers` directory in the Medusa server and add the following content:\n\n```\nimport { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from \"openai\";\n\nconst configuration = new Configuration({\n  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY, // Replace with your API key\n});\n\nclass DescriptionSubscriber {\n  constructor({ productService, eventBusService }) {\n    this.productService_ = productService;\n    eventBusService.subscribe(\"product.created\", this.handleDescription);\n  }\n  handleDescription = async (data) =\u003e {\n    let productDescription = \"\";\n\n    const product = await this.productService_.retrieve(data.id);\n    if (product.description == null) {\n      try {\n        const productName = product.title;\n        const productFeatures = [product.subtitle, product.material];\n        const prompt = `Write a product description for ${productName}, which has the following features: ${productFeatures.join(\n          \", \"\n        )}.`;\n\n        productDescription = await this.prepareDescription(prompt);\n      } catch (error) {\n        const errorMessage = error.response.data.error.message;\n        console.error(\"Error: \" + errorMessage);\n        return;\n      }\n\n\t\t\tproduct.description = productDescription;\n      await this.productService_.update(product.id, product);\n    }\n  };\n\n  prepareDescription = async (\n    prompt,\n    model = \"text-davinci-003\",\n    temperature = 0.7,\n    maxTokens = 256,\n    topP = 1,\n    frequencyPenalty = 0,\n    presencePenalty = 0\n  ) =\u003e {\n    const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);\n\n    const response = await openai.createCompletion({\n      model,\n      prompt,\n      temperature,\n      max_tokens: maxTokens,\n      top_p: topP,\n      frequency_penalty: frequencyPenalty,\n      presence_penalty: presencePenalty,\n    });\n\n    return response.data.choices[0].text.trim();\n  };\n}\n\nexport default DescriptionSubscriber;\n```\n\nIn the above code, you import the `Configuration` class from the `openai` module and then create a new `Configuration` object using the `Configuration` class. The `Configuration` object is initialized with an API key for the OpenAI API.\n\nYou also define a subscriber called `DescriptionSubscriber` which includes a constructor and two methods: `handleDescription` and `prepareDescription`.\n\nThe `constructor` method subscribes to an event called `product.created` using the `eventBusService` and specifies that the `handleDescription` method should be called whenever this event is emitted.\n\nThe `handleDescription` method is an async function that is called with a `data` argument. As mentioned [in the documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/subscribers/events-list#product-events), the event data payload, i.e., the `data` argument contains just the `id` of the created product. This method retrieves a product from the `productService` using the `id` property of the `data` object.\n\nIf the `description` of the product is `null`, the method generates a description using the `prepareDescription` method and updates the product with the new description.\n\n`prepareDescription` is an async function that is used to generate product descriptions using OpenAI's [Text Completion API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/text-completion). The function takes several parameters as inputs:\n\n*   `prompt`: a string that specifies the text prompt that the API should use as a starting point for generating text. In this case, the text that asks for a description of a product by its properties such as name, material, etc.\n\n*   `model`: (optional, default: `\"text-davinci-003\"`) a string that specifies the ID of the model that should be used to generate text.\n\n*   `temperature`: (optional, default: `0.7`) a float that specifies the sampling temperature to use when generating text.\n\n*   `maxTokens`: (optional, default: `256`) an integer that specifies the maximum number of [tokens](https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction/tokens) (i.e., words or word pieces) that should be generated.\n\n*   `topP`: (optional, default: `1`) a float that specifies the \"top-p\" value to use when generating text. Higher values will produce more conservative and deterministic output, while lower values will allow for more randomness and diversity in the output.\n\n*   `frequencyPenalty`: (optional, default: `0`) a float that specifies the frequency penalty to use when generating text. Higher values will produce more diverse output, while lower values will allow the model to reuse more common tokens.\n\n*   `presencePenalty`: (optional, default: `0`) a float that specifies the presence penalty to use when generating text.\n\nThe function creates an instance of the `OpenAIApi` class, which is used to communicate with the OpenAI API, and then calls the `createCompletion` method on this instance to generate text.\n\n## Testing the Flow\n\nOnce you’ve made the required changes in your Medusa server, you’ll need to build your project using the command:\n\n```\nnpm run build\n```\n\nNext, you can restart your server using the command:\n\n```\nmedusa develop\n```\n\n### Setting up Your Medusa Admin\n\nYou can test the flow both from the Medusa Admin and the [Admin APIs](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin/). In this case, you’ll test using the Medusa Admin.\n\nMedusa Admin is an intuitively designed admin dashboard for your ecommerce Medusa server. Medusa Admin is built with Vite 3 and React. It allows merchants to manage their data such as products, orders, discounts, regions, and more.\n\nFollow the steps to set up your Medusa Admin and create products:\n\nClone the Medusa Admin GitHub repository and change your path to the cloned directory:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/medusajs/admin my-medusa-admin\ncd my-medusa-admin\n```\n\nInstall the dependencies using the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install\n```\n\nOnce all the dependencies are installed, run the Admin server using the following command:\n\n```\nnpm run start\n```\n\nThe Medusa Admin runs on port 7000, so go to `http://localhost:7000` in your browser to open your Admin Panel.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot_2023-01-02_153211.png)\n\nSince you’ve already seeded the data in your Medusa server, you can use the email `admin@medusa-test.com` and password `supersecret` to log in.\n\n### Creating Products in Medusa Admin\n\nClick on the `Products` tab on the left side and then click on the `New Product` button.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot_2023-01-05_102325-173349ed.png)\n\nSince the admin is configured to fetch the products right after the product is created, which is before the subscriber runs, you’ll need to refresh the page to see the changes. You can customize the admin to refetch the product after it’s created to resolve this.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot_2023-01-05_102712.png)\n\nOnce you publish a product without a description, your product will initially be created with an empty description. The `product.created` event is then emitted, and the `DescriptionSubscriber` is triggered.\n\nSince the description is empty, the subscriber uses the `prepareDescription` function to generate a description and updates the description of the product.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot_2023-01-05_102525.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this tutorial, you learned how you can use ChatGPT to automate writing your product description. You can add more product features such as its price, variants, and more to generate a more unique description.\n\nThis integration was made easy due to Medusa’s composable architecture. You can learn more about Medusa through its [documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/). Here are some documents that you can start with:\n\n*   Set up a [Next.js](https://medusajs.com/nextjs-commerce/) storefront.\n*   Integrate [Stripe](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/stripe) as a payment provider.\n*   Create a [custom endpoint](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/endpoints/add).\n\n\u003e Should you have any issues or questions related to Medusa, then feel free to reach out to the Medusa team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp).\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/a-step-by-step-tutorial-on-how-to-deploy-a-medusa-server-on-aws.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/a-step-by-step-tutorial-on-how-to-deploy-a-medusa-server-on-aws.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/a-step-by-step-tutorial-on-how-to-deploy-a-medusa-server-on-aws.md"},"type":"PostLayout","mainPost":true,"title":"A Step-by-Step Tutorial on How to Deploy a Medusa Server on AWS","date":"2023-01-16","authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-h52o87abb.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-h52o87abb.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-h52o87abb.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Marija","lastName":"Naumovska","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/kEQP_XcDG.webp","altText":"Person photo"}}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-29bs7fo47.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json"},"type":"Category","name":"Community"},"excerpt":"Learn how to deploy Medusa on AWS with Microtica","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/microtica-min.jpg","altText":"Deploy a Medusa Server on AWS with Microtica","elementId":""},"seo_description":"Learn how to deploy Medusa on AWS with Microtica","markdown_content":"\n\u003ccallout icon=\"exclamationCircleSolid\" button-label=\"Go to Docs\" button-url=\"http://docs.medusajs.com\"\u003e\n**Notice**\nMedusa is under active development, so the content of this post may be outdated. Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\n[Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) is an open source composable commerce platform built for developers. Its architecture is flexible enabling users to build bespoke commerce solutions.\n\nMedusa is composed of three components:\n\n1.  A headless backend engine that holds all the logic and data of the store and exposes APIs to communicate with the admin and storefront,\n2.  An admin dashboard that allows store operators to manage their orders and products, and\n3.  A storefront, which is ultimately an ecommerce website where customers can preview products and make orders.\n\n## What is Microtica?\n\n[Microtica](https://www.microtica.com/) is a developer self-service platform that enables you to self-host open source solutions on AWS (Amazon Web Services) without being a cloud expert.\n\nThe platform provides production-ready templates for development frameworks and solutions, so you can get started fast and be free from the friction of dealing with the underlying cloud complexities.\n\nUsing the templates, you can deliver on your own AWS account and deploy applications/services on Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).\n\n## Why Should You Deploy Medusa Server on AWS?\n\nHere are some of the reasons why it would be a good idea to deploy a Medusa.js Server on AWS with Microtica’s template:\n\n*   Out-of-the-box serverless infrastructure with Fargate\n*   Infrastructure and data ownership on your AWS account\n*   Auto-scaling based on application load\n*   Automated git-push deployments and rollbacks\n*   Production-ready solution\n*   Resource monitoring and performance insights in-app\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo follow through with this tutorial, here’s a list of things you should have/do.\n\n*   Have a Git account; any provider from GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, and CodeCommit is supported.\n*   [Create a Microtica account](https://app.microtica.com/auth/signup?utm_source=devto\\\u0026utm_medium=blog\\\u0026utm_campaign=deploy+medusa+on+aws) by signing up with your email or your Git account.\n*   Have an AWS account to be able to deploy a React app to your AWS account. You can [sign up for an AWS account here.](https://aws.amazon.com/)\n\n## Deploy a New Medusa Server\n\nAfter creating a Microtica account, click the *Deploy with Microtica* button to land on the *Templates* page, where you can see a list of all production-ready templates.\n\n![](/images//THXCHbFZq6.jpg)\n\nThis template creates the following infrastructure resources that will be provisioned on your AWS account:\n\n*   VPC, subnets and networking\n*   Container infrastructure based on Fargate\n*   Application load balancer\n*   Persistent storage\n*   S3 bucket\n*   Postgres database\n*   Redis (in production mode)\n\nThe steps to deploying a new Medusa server are outlined below.\n\n### Create a Git Repository\n\nConnect your preferred Git account. Microtica will create a repository on your Git account with a default repo name `medusa-server`.\n\n![](/images//nTZPm9Fyis.png)\n\n### Configure Template\n\nHere, you can customize the template for your needs by providing environment variables. Enter an application name and the admin credentials that will be used to create an initial admin user with which you can later sign in to your Medusa Admin.\n\nSelect whether you want a production Medusa Server environment or a development one. In production mode, this template will provision managed RDS PostgreSQL and Redis instances. In development mode, the template will use local SQLite and a fake Redis instance.\n\n![](/images//ujvPPLbsyo.png)\n\nEnvironment variables can be updated, added, or configured after deployment as well.\n\n### Connect an AWS account\n\nIn the last step, you can select the environment in which you want to deploy the template. An existing default environment called `development` will be preselected here or you can create a new environment.\n\nConnect your AWS account when prompted. This process takes only a few seconds, so afterwards, only choose the region you want to deploy in.\n\n![](/images//rHQmxc0rBJ.png)\n\n### Deploy the Medusa Server Template to AWS\n\nFinally, a deployment summary of what will be provisioned on your AWS account is presented.\n\n![](/images//vwUF_K9zRz.png)\n\nClicking the *Deploy* button will trigger a deployment of the template and start creating the infrastructure for a Medusa Server.\n\nIt will take about 10 mins for the solution to be deployed on the cloud; you can follow the build pipeline in real time by clicking the *View Logs* button.\n\n![](/images//TcfKjLjkLe.png)\n\nOnce the build process is complete, a new deployment with the infrastructure resources is triggered. You can follow the logs of the deployment process by clicking the *View deployment* button, and then selecting the deployment from the list.\n\n![](/images//thr0qC6h4m.png)\n\n### Preview the Environment\n\nAfter the deployment is finished, navigate to *Resources* → [*AppName*](https://dev.tomedusa%20in%20our%20case/) → *Overview*, and under *Resource Outputs* you should see the AccessUrl.\n\nThis is the server URL that you can use to access API endpoints. Try getting the list of products using the endpoint `/store/products`.\n\n![](/images//Y284EZGh1U.png)\n\nThe image below shows how your environment should look after deploying both templates.\n\n![](/images//jNxhPN9Afv.png)\n\n## Cleanup\n\nTo remove all the resources created on your AWS account, navigate to your environment → *Environment Settings* → *Infrastructure*, and you’ll see the *Undeploy* section.\n\nThis will clean up the resources created in AWS, but you will still have the configuration in Microtica in case you want to deploy it in the cloud again.\n\n## Deploy an Existing Medusa Server\n\nIf you already have an existing Medusa server repository that you want to migrate to AWS, there are several changes you need to make to your source code. You can follow [the documentation](https://docs.microtica.com/medusa-server?utm_source=devto\\\u0026utm_medium=blog\\\u0026utm_campaign=deploy+medusa+on+aws) to configure and import your Medusa server repo code.\n\n\u003e Should you have any issues or questions related to Medusa, then feel free to reach out to the Medusa team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp).\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/nodejs-ecommerce-backend.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/nodejs-ecommerce-backend.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/nodejs-ecommerce-backend.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":" The #1 Node.js Ecommerce Backend: Medusa","date":"2023-01-11","excerpt":"Learn about Medusa, the #1 Node.js ecommerce backend.","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/node-js-backend-min.jpg","altText":"The #1 Nodejs ecommerce backend: Medusa","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-ns0w0s3w2.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-ns0w0s3w2.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-ns0w0s3w2.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Ashutosh","lastName":"Krishna","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/ashu-dp.jpg","altText":"Person photo"}}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-29bs7fo47.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json"},"type":"Category","name":"Community"},"markdown_content":"\n\u003ccallout icon=\"exclamationCircleSolid\" button-label=\"Go to Docs\" button-url=\"http://docs.medusajs.com\"\u003e\n**Notice**\nMedusa is under active development, so the content of this post may be outdated. Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\n[Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) offers bespoke commerce infrastructure and is the most popular open source commerce platform on GitHub. The solution allows developers to build scalable and custom ecommerce applications through a composable stack that allows you to easily integrate with your favorite tools for payments to search, CMS and more.\n\nYou can easily manage your products, add discounts and gift cards as offers, support multiple currencies and regions, and much more. These are possible due to Medusa’s headless architecture that decouples its backend server, storefront, and admin dashboard.\n\nIn this article, you will learn what headless commerce architecture is and the benefits of headless commerce solutions. Additionally, you will learn about Medusa, the #1 Node.js ecommerce backend, and its underlying architecture in detail.\n\n## **Medusa, the Most Popular Node.js Ecommerce Backend**\n\nMedusa is a composable commerce platform that utilizes Node.js’s superpowers on the server to provide a great developer experience and advanced ecommerce features. It is highly customizable and easy to maintain.\n\nMedusa offers standard ecommerce features including payments, cart functionality, user management, discounts, gifts, and more, much like other ecommerce platforms. An ecommerce business can use Medusa to build an ecommerce stores of different types and purposes.\n\nReleased in 2021, Medusa has gained about 15K stars in a little more than a year, making it the most popular ecommerce engine on GitHub. Currently, Medusa has +16K stars, passing other popular open source platforms like Magento and PrestaShop.\n\nHere are some reasons why Medusa has become the most popular Node.js ecommerce backend:\n\n1.  Medusa has an abstraction-based architecture built for easy customization and maintainability. It enables you to set up your store according to your specific business needs.\n2.  Medusa is entirely open source, in contrast to other ecommerce platforms that use proprietary backends. Thus, you can extend its functionalities with custom features and third-party services.\n3.  Since the frontend and backend are decoupled, developers can choose any frontend framework to build the storefront.\n4.  Medusa supports a wide variety of third-party integrations out of the box. You can easily integrate search engine services like [Algolia](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/algolia/) and [Meilisearch](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/meilisearch/), payment services such as [Stripe](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/stripe/) and [PayPal](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/paypal/), notification solutions such as [SendGrid](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/sendgrid/) and [Twilio](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/twilio-sms/), and more. You can find the list of integrations supported by Medusa [here](https://www.notion.so/1a0ada9903874e0185d0b8ce0591b359).\n5.  Medusa has great community support with over 4000+ developers on its Discord channel always ready to help and support others. Developers can also help Medusa grow by taking part in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/discussions) with other ecommerce builders, open source developers, and the Medusa core team.\n6.  With the lack of available Node.js ecommerce backends and the need for it, and with the popularity of Node.js, this made many businesses and developers interested in Medusa, as it is built on top of Node.js.\n\n### **Why is Node.js Popular?**\n\nThere are a few reasons behind the high popularity of Node.js frameworks among web developers:\n\n1.  JavaScript is Everywhere: One of the main factors of its popularity is that Node.js is a backend JavaScript runtime environment. JavaScript is widely used today for building web apps and can be used on both the client and server sides when building a Node.js application.\n2.  Lightweight: Node.js has a basic event-driven architecture. In other words, every action and call made on it is made up of a sequence of asynchronous callbacks. As a result, Node.js operates on a single thread, while other web technologies create a new thread for each client request.\n3.  Lightning Fast: Node.js is powered by Chrome’s V8 engine. Since V8 compiles JavaScript into native machine code, it can compile and execute JavaScript at a lightning-fast speed.\n4.  Real-time functionality: Node.js is an ideal choice for building real-time applications, such as chat applications and real-time notifications. For ecommerce, this can be very beneficial, as real-time functionality can improve the user experience, such as getting notifications about order status updates.\n5.  Mobile-Friendly, Cross-Platform: Cross-platform ecommerce app development has increased over the past few years. Node.js allows you to build flexible apps that can run on any platform.\n\nOther reasons for the Node.js popularity include its high performance and scalability. The support for microservices architecture makes Node.js ecommerce backends one of the best choices for ecommerce development.\n\n## **Medusa's Architecture**\n\nAs discussed, Medusa has a composable architecture, meaning the frontend and backend are loosely coupled. Medusa is composed of three components: the headless backend, the admin dashboard, and the storefront.\n\nYou can choose to use the complete Medusa platform or just the parts that you require for your store. Also, the decoupling of the backend from the frontend allows a backend developer to focus on the Medusa server, and the frontend developer to focus on the storefront or admin.\n\n![Medusa Architecture](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1667999772/Medusa%20Docs/Diagrams/ZHvM2bu_td4rnx.png)\n\nMedusa Architecture\n\nThe following sections explain how Medusa provides most of the ecommerce store functionalities out of the box. You just need to configure these functionalities as per your use case.\n\n### **Medusa Server**\n\nThe Medusa server is a core component of Medusa. It is a Node.js ecommerce backend. It contains all the store's logic and data. The other two components use the REST APIs exposed by the backend server to retrieve, create, and modify data.\n\nThe Medusa server comes with most of the functionalities related to an ecommerce workflow. These functionalities include product, cart, and order management, shipping and payment providers, user management, and more.\n\nIn addition to that, you can configure your store including your store’s region, tax rules, discounts, gift cards, and more.\n\nSetting up a Medusa headless backend server is just a matter of a single command. You have the freedom to select any storefront because Medusa comes with a full commerce engine and APIs to manage your entire store.\n\nSince Medusa is highly extensible, it allows developers to build custom features or integrate third-party services into Medusa using Plugins. You can find both official and community plugins to assist you with your common needs. Learn more about these plugins [here](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/plugins/overview/).\n\nYou can easily extend and customize the functionalities of your Medusa server. You can add endpoints, business logic, and database entities to handle customizations. In addition, you can create subscribers in your Medusa server that listens to events to perform an action.\n\n### **Medusa Admin**\n\nMedusa Admin is quite an essential component of an ecommerce store. Merchants use this dashboard to view, create, and modify data such as orders and products.\n\nMedusa includes an admin dashboard to provide functionalities to manage your store including order management, product management, user management, and more. You can manage your orders across regions and channels using one single dashboard.\n\nIf you're migrating your store from other platforms, the admin dashboard provides you with functionalities to easily import and export large datasets on products, orders, and customers. The dashboard also provides you with customer-group functionality that allows you to create tailored pricing lists, discounts, and gift cards.\n\nThe Medusa Admin Dashboard looks like this:\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2022-12-05\\_153210.png)\n\nHowever, if you are not satisfied with the existing admin dashboard, you can utilize the [Admin REST APIs](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin) to extend it beyond.\n\n### **Storefront**\n\nStorefront is the frontend or the main presentation layer of your ecommerce store. It is the storefront where your customers can view and purchase your products. These storefronts may be progressive web applications or mobile apps.\n\nMedusa provides two storefront starters: one using [Next.js](https://docs.medusajs.com/starters/nextjs-medusa-starter) and the other using [Gatsby](https://docs.medusajs.com/starters/gatsby-medusa-starter).\n\n![](/images/koJl8uR_n3gvii-0d8094c5.gif)\n\nThe Next.js storefront includes the following features:\n\n*   Product listing and detail pages with a clear design.\n*   Customer authentication and profile functionalities, allowing customers to view their orders, edit their information, and more.\n*   Full checkout flow supporting shipping details and methods, and ready integration with payment gateways such as Stripe and PayPal.\n*   Search capabilities that is ready to integrate with best-in-breed solutions like Algolia and MeiliSearch.\n\nYou are also free to create your own storefront using the [Storefront REST APIs](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store/).\n\n## How to Get Started with Medusa\n\nYou can get started with Medusa by following the [Medusa’s Quickstart guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start/).\n\nAfter that, you can follow these guides to kick-start your development with Medusa:\n\n*   [Create custom API routes](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/endpoints/add)\n*   [Create a service](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/services/create-service) that bundles a set of methods related to an entity.\n*   [Create a subscriber](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/subscribers/create-subscriber) that listens to events to perform an action asynchronously.\n*   [Deploy your Medusa server to Railway.](https://medusajs.com/blog/deplot-medusa-server-railway/)\n*   [Integrate Chatwoot live widget with the Next.js storefront.](https://medusajs.com/blog/chatwoot-ecommerce/)\n*   [Integrate Discord for automatic order notifications.](https://medusajs.com/blog/chatwoot-ecommerce/)\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nUsing a Node.js ecommerce backend provides both businesses and developers many benefits. Those include high scalability, a good performance, and utilizing full-stack JavaScript development.\n\nWhen considering a Node.js ecommerce backend, Medusa is the ideal choice. Built on top of Node.js, Medusa provides many essential ecommerce and development features. Businesses that use Medusa can benefit from both advantages that Node.js and Medusa provide.\n\n\u003e Should you have any issues or questions related to Medusa, then feel free to reach out to the Medusa team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp).\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/react-ecommerce-store-medusa.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/react-ecommerce-store-medusa.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/react-ecommerce-store-medusa.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Create a React Ecommerce Store with Medusa","date":"2023-01-11","excerpt":"In this tutorial, learn how to build a React ecommerce store with Medusa.","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/react-ecommerce-min.jpg","altText":"Create a React Ecommerce Store with Medusa","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-xg6zy61g5.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-xg6zy61g5.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-xg6zy61g5.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Alyssa","lastName":"Holland","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/OS7q5dwgq.webp","altText":"Alyssa Holland"}}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-29bs7fo47.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json"},"type":"Category","name":"Community"},"markdown_content":"\n\u003ccallout icon=\"exclamationCircleSolid\" button-label=\"Go to Docs\" button-url=\"http://docs.medusajs.com\"\u003e\n**Notice**\nMedusa is under active development, so the content of this post may be outdated. Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\nThis guide will explain how to set up [Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) in a React application. Medusa is an open source headless commerce engine built for developers. Medusa's composable architecture allows for endless customization and provides a friendly developer experience.  React is a popular JavaScript library that provides a declarative and component-based architecture for building user interfaces.\n\nThroughout this tutorial, you will learn how to build a React ecommerce store with Medusa. You will learn how to set up the Medusa server and admin panel and build out some pages to make up the storefront.\n\nThe code for the project developed in this article can be found in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aholland-work/react-medusa-storefront).\n\n![](/images/add-to-cart.gif)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo complete this tutorial, you will need:\n\n*   [Node.js](https://docs.medusajs.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment/#nodejs) version 14.18+ or 16+ installed on your local machine.\n*   One of the following package managers: `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` (This tutorial will specifically use `npm`.)\n\n## Set up the Medusa Server\n\nIn order to set up the server, you first need to install Medusa's CLI with the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install @medusajs/medusa-cli -g\n```\n\nNext, run the following command to install the Medusa server:\n\n```\nmedusa new medusa-server --seed\n```\n\nThe command above installs the necessary packages and adds the Medusa server to the `medusa-server` directory. The `--seed` command populates an SQLite database with sample data that can be referenced from the storefront and admin panel.\n\n### Test the Medusa Server\n\nNavigate to the `medusa-server` folder and start the server:\n\n```\ncd medusa-server\nmedusa develop\n```\n\nThe command above launches the server on `localhost:9000`.\n\nYou now have a complete commerce engine running locally. You can verify that the server is running by going to `http://localhost:9000/store/products` in your browser. You should see a JSON blob that has the following response:\n\n![](/images/2-localhost-9000-store-products.jpeg)\n\nJSON response of sample products data\n\nIf you want the ability to upload product images to your Medusa server, you will need to install and configure a file service plugin like [S3](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/s3) or [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/spaces).\n\n## Setup the Medusa Admin\n\nMedusa provides an admin dashboard with numerous functionalities that equip you to manage your store, including order and product management.\n\nTo set up the Medusa Admin, clone the [Admin GitHub repository](https://github.com/medusajs/admin):\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/medusajs/admin medusa-admin \n```\n\nChange into the cloned directory and then install the dependencies:\n\n```\ncd medusa-admin\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Test the Medusa Admin\n\nBefore testing the Medusa admin, ensure that the Medusa server is up and running.\n\nOnce the installation of dependencies is complete and the Medusa server is running, execute the following command to start the Medusa admin:\n\n```\nnpm run start\n```\n\nYou can now view the Medusa Admin in the browser at `http://localhost:7000/` where you will be prompted with the following login screen:\n\n![Medusa Admin Login Screen](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1668001604/Medusa%20Docs/Screenshots/XYqMCo9\\_hq1fsv.png)\n\nMedusa Admin Login Screen\n\nTo log in, you’ll need to input the credentials of the demo user that was created when the server’s database was seeded. For the email field, enter `admin@medusa-test.com`, and for the password field, enter `supersecret`.\n\nOnce logged in, click on “Products” in the sidebar menu. Here, you will see a list of demo products and you can add a few products by clicking on the “New Product” button in the upper right-hand corner.\n\n![](/images/Medusa_Admin_Products_Page.png)\n\nTo learn more about the features and functionalities of the Medusa Admin, check out the [user guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/user-guide/).\n\n## Setup the React App\n\nIn this section, you will scaffold a React application with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects and is an alternative to tools like [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).\n\nRun one of the following commands to create a Vite app. The command will vary slightly depending on the npm version that you have installed:\n\n```\n# for npm version 6.x\nnpm create vite@latest react-medusa-storefront --template react\n\n# for npm version 7+, extra double-dash is needed\nnpm create vite@latest react-medusa-storefront -- --template react\n```\n\nFrom here, change into the new directory and install the project dependencies:\n\n```\ncd react-medusa-storefront\nnpm install\n```\n\nStart the dev server locally:\n\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nNavigate to `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser and you should now see a screen similar to the one below.\n\n![](/images/Vite-landing_page.jpeg)\n\nVite default landing page\n\n### Install React Bootstrap\n\nTo assist with styling and building the components for the storefront you will use [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction/). To install, run the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install react-bootstrap bootstrap\n```\n\nIn order to apply the styles needed for the React Bootstrap library, you need to add the following import to the top of `src/main.jsx`:\n\n```\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\n```\n\n### Update the CSS\n\nImporting the React Bootstrap stylesheet in `src/main.jsx` applies a myriad of base styles therefore the stylesheet can be trimmed down.\n\nOpen `src/index.css` and replace its content with the following CSS:\n\n```\n:root {\n  font-family: Inter, Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\n  font-size: 16px;\n  line-height: 24px;\n  font-weight: 400;\n  font-synthesis: none;\n  text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\n  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;\n  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;\n  -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\n}\n\na {\n  font-weight: 500;\n}\na:hover {\n  cursor: pointer;\n}\n\nbody {\n  margin: 0;\n  min-height: 100vh;\n}\n```\n\n### Install React Router\n\nIn order to enable [client-side routing](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/overview#client-side-routing) in our app, we will need to install and configure [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) by running the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install react-router-dom\n```\n\nSince `src/main.jsx` is our entry point, we need to import `[BrowserRouter](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/router-components/browser-router)` and wrap the `App` component within it. Doing so will enable client-side routing for our entire web app.\n\nOpen `src/main.jsx` and replace its contents with the following code:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'\nimport { BrowserRouter } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport App from './App'\nimport './index.css'\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\n\nReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(\n  \u003cReact.StrictMode\u003e\n    \u003cBrowserRouter\u003e\n      \u003cApp /\u003e\n    \u003c/BrowserRouter\u003e\n  \u003c/React.StrictMode\u003e\n)\n```\n\nWith React Router installed and configured, we can begin to build out the other pages for the storefront.\n\n## **Connect the React Storefront to the Medusa Server**\n\nThe [Medusa JS Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@medusajs/medusa-js) is an [SDK](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/sdk-vs-api) that provides an easy way to access the Medusa API from a web application. This Medusa JS client is an alternative to interacting with the [REST APIs](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store).\n\nRun the following command to install the Medusa JS Client:\n\n```\nnpm install @medusajs/medusa-js\n```\n\nMedusa uses CORS to only allow specific origins to access the server. By default, the Medusa server is configured to allow access to the storefront on port `8000`. Because the default port for Vite is `5713`,  you need to [configure Vite](https://vitejs.dev/config/) to point to the desired port number.\n\nTo address this, add the `[server.port](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-port)` option to the \\`\\` file:\n\n```\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\nimport react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'\n\n// https://vitejs.dev/config/\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [react()],\n  server: {\n    port: 8000,\n  },\n})\n```\n\nRestart the Vite dev server to reflect the changes made in the config file, and you can now open a new browser tab at `http://localhost:8000/`.\n\n### Create Medusa JS Client Utility\n\nCreate a new file at the root of the project called `.env` and add the following environment variable that points to the URL of the Medusa server:\n\n```\nVITE_MEDUSA_SERVER_URL=\"http://localhost:9000\"\n```\n\nVite requires all [env variables](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-files) that need to be exposed to the client source code to be prefixed with `VITE_` and exposes the environment variable to the client via `import.meta.env.VITE_MEDUSA_SERVER_URL`.\n\nCreate the file `src/utils/client.js` and add the following code to create a utility that will make accessing the instance of the Medusa JS Client reusable across the application:\n\n```\nimport Medusa from \"@medusajs/medusa-js\"\n\nconst medusaClient = new Medusa({ baseUrl: import.meta.env.VITE_MEDUSA_SERVER_URL })\n\nexport { medusaClient }\n```\n\n## Create the Storefront Components\n\nThis section will cover building out the components that will compose the home page of product listings. Here is a list of the components that we will be building in this section:\n\n1.  **NavHeader -** Displays the logo, links, and shopping cart info.\n2.  **ProductCard -** Displays metadata about the products.\n\nTo start, create a new `components` folder in the `/src` directory to house all the components we will build for the storefront.\n\n### NavHeader Component\n\nCreate the file `src/components/NavHeader.jsx` and add the following code:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport Container from 'react-bootstrap/Container';\nimport Navbar from 'react-bootstrap/Navbar';\nimport Nav from 'react-bootstrap/Nav';\nimport Badge from 'react-bootstrap/Badge';\n\nexport default function NavHeader() {\n    const cartCount = localStorage.getItem('cartCount') ?? 0\n\n    return (\n        \u003cNavbar bg=\"dark\" variant=\"dark\"\u003e\n            \u003cContainer fluid\u003e\n                \u003cNav className=\"w-25 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-between\"\u003e\n                    \u003cimg\n                        alt=\"Medusa logo\"\n

`NavHeader` component contains a link back to the home page via the “Products” link and a total count of the number of items that have been added to the cart.\n\n### ProductCard Component\n\nIn the `components` directory, create a new file called `ProductCard.jsx` and add the following code:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types';\nimport Card from 'react-bootstrap/Card';\n\nexport default function ProductCard(props) {\n    const formattedPrice = new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', { style: 'currency', currency: 'USD' }).format(props.price / 100)\n    \n\t\treturn (\n        \u003cCard\u003e\n            \u003cCard.Img variant=\"top\" src={props.thumbnail} alt={props.title} /\u003e\n            \u003cCard.Body\u003e\n                \u003cCard.Title\u003e{props.title}\u003c/Card.Title\u003e\n                \u003cCard.Text className='text-success fw-bold'\u003e\n                    {formattedPrice}\n                \u003c/Card.Text\u003e\n                \u003cLink to={`/products/${props.productId}`}\u003eView Details\u003c/Link\u003e\n            \u003c/Card.Body\u003e\n        \u003c/Card\u003e\n    )\n}\n\nProductCard.propTypes = {\n    title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n    thumbnail: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\n    price: PropTypes.number.isRequired,\n    productId: PropTypes.string.isRequired\n};\n```\n\nThis component uses [React Bootstrap’s Card component](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/cards/) to display metadata about each product.\n\n## Create the Home Page\n\nThe home page is the root route that uses the [Medusa JS Client’s `list` method](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/js-client/classes/ProductsResource#list) to pull in a list of products and display information about them using the `ProductCard` component that was created earlier.\n\nCreate a new file in`src/routes/Home.jsx` and add the following code:\n\n```\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'\nimport Col from 'react-bootstrap/Col';\nimport Row from 'react-bootstrap/Row';\nimport ProductCard from '../components/ProductCard'\nimport { medusaClient } from '../utils/client.js'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n    const [products, setProducts] = useState([])\n\n    useEffect(() =\u003e {\n        const getProducts = async () =\u003e {\n            const results = await medusaClient.products.list();\n            setProducts(results.products)\n        }\n\n        getProducts()\n    }, []);\n\n    return (\n        \u003c\u003e\n            \u003cheader\u003e\n                \u003ch1 className=\"my-4\"\u003eAll Products\u003c/h1\u003e\n            \u003c/header\u003e\n            \u003cmain\u003e\n                \u003cRow xs={1} sm={2} md={3} lg={4} className=\"g-4\"\u003e\n                    {products.map((product) =\u003e (\n                        \u003cCol key={product.id}\u003e\n                            \u003cProductCard\n                                title={product.title}\n                                productId={product.id}\n                                price={product.variants[0].prices[1].amount}\n                                thumbnail={product.thumbnail} /\u003e\n                        \u003c/Col\u003e\n                    ))}\n                \u003c/Row\u003e\n            \u003c/main\u003e\n        \u003c/\u003e\n    )\n}\n```\n\n### Register the Home Page Route\n\nNext, leverage React Routers `[Routes](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/routes)` and `[Route](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/route)` components in order to register the pages needed for the react webshop.\n\nOpen up `src/App.jsx` and update it to include the following code:\n\n```\nimport { Routes, Route } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport './App.css'\nimport NavHeader from './components/NavHeader'\nimport Home from './routes/Home'\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv className=\"App\"\u003e\n      \u003cNavHeader /\u003e\n      \u003cRoutes\u003e\n        \u003cRoute path=\"/\" element={\u003cHome /\u003e} /\u003e\n      \u003c/Routes\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App\n```\n\nWith this setup, the `NavHeader` component will be visible across all our routes and the list of all products can be viewed at the root route.\n\n### Test the Home Page\n\nEnsure that the Medusa server and the storefront are running and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/` to see a preview of the home page:\n\n![](/images/Medusa_Products_List.jpeg)\n\nList of all products on the home page\n\n## Create the Product Page\n\nIn the `routes` folder, create a new file called `Product.jsx` and add the following code:\n\n```\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'\nimport { useParams } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport Container from 'react-bootstrap/Container';\nimport Row from 'react-bootstrap/Row';\nimport Col from 'react-bootstrap/Col';\nimport Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button';\nimport { medusaClient } from '../utils/client.js'\n\nconst getFormattedPrice = (amount) =\u003e {\n    return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', { style: 'currency', currency: 'USD' }).format(amount / 100);\n}\n\n// TODO: Add functions to handle the add to cart functionality\n\nexport default function Product() {\n   const { id } = useParams();\n   const [product, setProduct] = useState({})\n\n    useEffect(() =\u003e {\n        const getIndividualProduct = async () =\u003e {\n            const results = await medusaClient.products.retrieve(id);\n            setProduct(results.product)\n        }\n\n        getIndividualProduct()\n    }, []);\n\n    return (\n      \u003cmain className=\"mt-5\"\u003e\n          \u003cContainer\u003e\n              \u003cRow\u003e\n                  \u003cCol\u003e\n                      \u003cimg width=\"500px\"\n                          alt={product.title}\n                          src={product.thumbnail} /\u003e\n                  \u003c/Col\u003e\n                  \u003cCol className=\"d-flex justify-content-center flex-column\"\u003e\n                      \u003ch1\u003e{product.title}\u003c/h1\u003e\n                      \u003cp className=\"mb-4 text-success fw-bold\"\u003e{getFormattedPrice(product.variants?.[0]?.prices?.[1]?.amount)}\u003c/p\u003e\n                      \u003cp className=\"mb-5\"\u003e{product.description}\u003c/p\u003e\n                      \u003cButton variant=\"success\" size=\"lg\" onClick={() =\u003e { console.log(\"Add to cart\") }}\u003eAdd to cart\u003c/Button\u003e\n                  \u003c/Col\u003e\n              \u003c/Row\u003e\n          \u003c/Container\u003e\n      \u003c/main\u003e\n    )\n}\n```\n\nThis code takes the ID in the URL’s query param and uses the [Medusa JS Client’s `retrieve` method](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/js-client/classes/ProductsResource#retrieve) to obtain information about an individual product.\n\n### Register the Product Page Route\n\nRe-open `src/App.jsx`, import the `Product` page component, and add a new React Router `Route` that will point to the individual product page:\n\n```\nimport { Routes, Route } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport './App.css'\nimport NavHeader from './components/NavHeader'\nimport Home from './routes/Home'\nimport Product from './routes/Product'\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv className=\"App\"\u003e\n      \u003cNavHeader /\u003e\n      \u003cRoutes\u003e\n        \u003cRoute path=\"/\" element={\u003cHome /\u003e} /\u003e\n        \u003cRoute path=\"products/:id\" element={\u003cProduct /\u003e} /\u003e\n      \u003c/Routes\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App\n```\n\n### Test the Product Page\n\nTo test this out, click on the “View Details” button for the “Medusa Sweatpants” and you will be directed to the product's details page:\n\n![](/images/Individual_Product_Page.jpeg)\n\nProduct page for the “Medusa Sweatpants”\n\n## Create Add to Cart Functionality\n\nTo wire up the logic for the add-to-cart functionality, you need to check if a cart was previously created or not.\n\nFor this example, if the `cartID` is present, then we call the [add the line item to the cart](https://docs.medusajs.com/guides/carts-in-medusa/#add-line-item-to-the-cart) and store the cart’s item count in local storage under the `cartCount` field. If the `cartID` is not present, then we [create a new cart](https://docs.medusajs.com/guides/carts-in-medusa/#create-a-cart) and store the newly generated ID in local storage. The `cartCount` is used to update the display count in the navigation header.\n\nRe-open `Product.jsx` in the `routes` folder and update the file to include the following code:\n\n```\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'\nimport { useParams } from 'react-router-dom'\nimport Container from 'react-bootstrap/Container';\nimport Row from 'react-bootstrap/Row';\nimport Col from 'react-bootstrap/Col';\nimport Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button';\nimport { medusaClient } from '../utils/client.js'\n\nconst getFormattedPrice = (amount) =\u003e {\n    return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', { style: 'currency', currency: 'USD' }).format(amount / 100);\n}\n\nconst addProduct = async (cartId, product) =\u003e {\n    const { cart } = await medusaClient.carts.lineItems.create(cartId, {\n        variant_id: product.variants[0].id, //For simplicities sake only adding the first variant\n        quantity: 1\n    })\n    localStorage.setItem('cartCount', cart.items.length)\n    window.location.reload()\n}\n\nexport default function Product() {\n    // Get the product ID param from the URL.\n    const { id } = useParams();\n    const [product, setProduct] = useState({})\n    const [regionId, setRegionId] = useState(\"\")\n\n    useEffect(() =\u003e {\n        const getIndividualProduct = async () =\u003e {\n            const results = await medusaClient.products.retrieve(id);\n            setProduct(results.product)\n        }\n\n        const getRegions = async () =\u003e {\n            const results = await medusaClient.regions.list()\n            setRegionId(results.regions[1].id)\n        }\n\n        getIndividualProduct()\n        getRegions()\n    }, []);\n\n    const handleAddToCart = async () =\u003e {\n        const cartId = localStorage.getItem('cartId');\n\n        if (cartId) {\n            //A cart was previously created so use the cartId found in localStorage\n            addProduct(cartId, product)\n        } else {\n            //Create a cart if there isn't a pre-existing one\n            const { cart } = await medusaClient.carts.create({ region_id: regionId })\n            localStorage.setItem('cartId', cart.id);\n\n            //Use the newly generated cart's ID\n            addProduct(cart.id, product)\n        }\n    }\n\n    return (\n        \u003cmain className=\"mt-5\"\u003e\n            \u003cContainer\u003e\n                \u003cRow\u003e\n                    \u003cCol\u003e\n                        \u003cimg width=\"500px\"\n                            alt={product.title}\n                            src={product.thumbnail} /\u003e\n                    \u003c/Col\u003e\n                    \u003cCol className=\"d-flex justify-content-center flex-column\"\u003e\n                        \u003ch1\u003e{product.title}\u003c/h1\u003e\n                        \u003cp className=\"mb-4 text-success fw-bold\"\u003e{getFormattedPrice(product.variants?.[0]?.prices?.[1]?.amount)}\u003c/p\u003e\n                        \u003cp className=\"mb-5\"\u003e{product.description}\u003c/p\u003e\n                        \u003cButton variant=\"success\" size=\"lg\" onClick={handleAddToCart}\u003eAdd to Cart\u003c/Button\u003e\n                    \u003c/Col\u003e\n                \u003c/Row\u003e\n            \u003c/Container\u003e\n        \u003c/main\u003e\n    )\n}\n```\n\nThe code above adds the following functionality:\n\n1.  `addProduct` async function that uses the `medusaClient` utility to add a product to a cart.\n2.  `getRegions` function to grab a [list of all the regions](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/js-client/classes/RegionsResource#list) and set it to the US region found at the first index in the `regions` array. This ID then gets stored in the `regionId` state variable.\n3.  `handleAddToCart` function that is invoked when the “Add to Cart” button is clicked.\n\nFor simplicities sake, the code adds the first variant of a product. This means that a product can only be added to a cart once. In addition, a page reload is initiated in order to pick up the new cart count. This decision was intentional to keep the project simple but know that a real-world app could allow the ability to select different variants and add more advanced capabilities.\n\n### Test Add to Cart Functionality\n\nTo test out the functionality, click on the “View Details” link for any item to navigate to the product details page. From there, click on the “Add to Cart” button which will initiate a page refresh and update the cart’s badge count in the navigation header.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2023-01-02\\_at\\_10.11.07\\_AM.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThroughout this tutorial, you learned about the [Medusa Admin](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/quickstart), [Medusa Server](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start), and how you can use the [Medusa JS Client](https://docs.medusajs.com/js-client/overview/) to create a sample ecommerce store with React. A lot of material was covered, however, there is still so much more that you can generate with Medusa such as:\n\n*   Expanding upon the “add to cart” functionality and building a shopping cart screen that [retrieves a cart](https://docs.medusajs.com/guides/carts-in-medusa/#retrieve-a-cart) and displays a list of all the products that have been added to it.\n*   Payment integrations with [Stripe](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/stripe).\n*   [Implementing a Checkout Flow](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/storefront/how-to-implement-checkout-flow/)\n\nShould you have any issues or questions related to Medusa, then feel free to reach out to the Medusa team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp).\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/implementing-5-features-in-nike-ecommerce-store-with-medusa.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/implementing-5-features-in-nike-ecommerce-store-with-medusa.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/implementing-5-features-in-nike-ecommerce-store-with-medusa.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Transform Your Ecommerce with Medusa Implementing 5 Powerful Nike Features","date":"2023-01-10","excerpt":"Unlock the full potential of your ecommerce store with Medusa  using Nike's 5 powerful performant features.","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/nike-store.jpg","altText":"Implementing 5 features in Nike’s Ecommerce Store with Medusa","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"seo_description":"Unlock the full potential of your ecommerce store with Medusa using Nike's 5 powerful performant features.","seo_keywords":"ecommerce, customer satisfaction","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-eb2no2kx3.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-eb2no2kx3.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-eb2no2kx3.json"},"firstName":"Shahed ","lastName":"Nasser","role":"Role","image":{"url":"/images/27354907.jpeg","altText":"Person photo"},"type":"Person"}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-a9wemp4po.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json"},"name":"Other","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"\n\u003ccallout icon=\"exclamationCircleSolid\" button-label=\"Go to Docs\" button-url=\"http://docs.medusajs.com\"\u003e\n**Notice**\nMedusa is under active development, so the content of this post may be outdated.

Part of what makes Nike successful is its ecommerce website. Its net sales has [crossed 12 billion USD in 2022](https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1218320/nike-revenue-development-ecommercedb). This makes up approximately 65% of Nike’s [global direct-to-customer revenue in 2022 (18.73 billion USD)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/294512/nike-s-dtc-revenue-worldwide/).\n\nNike’s ecommerce website is rich with features that encourage customers to make a purchase. It shows a great understanding of what customers want, and how to convert first-time visitors to loyal customers.\n\nNike realized early-on that they needed to implement an [omnichannel experience](https://medium.com/nikeengineering/accelerate-transforming-nike-digital-apis-with-graphql-a541aebe4d5e) to provide their customers with the best user experience. This led them to build their own headless commerce platforms utilizing [microservices and cloud technologies](https://medium.com/nikeengineering/nikes-cloud-journey-at-aws-re-invent-aa2e6eaefa55).\n\nIn this article, you’ll learn how to implement 5 core features Nike offers its customers using Medusa. These are:\n\n1.  Digital Gift Cards\n2.  Free shipping for members\n3.  Search suggestions and autocomplete\n4.  Member-only products\n5.  Birthday deals\n\n## What is Medusa?\n\nUsing an open source ecommerce platform gives you many of the benefits of customization that a custom platform like Nike’s has. [Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) is built for developers that wants to build bespoke commerce experiences with a composable commerce platforms in Node.js.\n\nMedusa’s architecture allows businesses and developers to build unique and on-brand experiences. Features such as omnichannel support, scalability, and customizability are at Medusa’s core.\n\nMedusa also provides advanced ecommerce features related to automated RMA flows, sales channels, product and order management, and much more.\n\nMedusa’s integrations system gives businesses more flexibility. You can integrate any third-party service into Medusa for rich CMS functionalities, payment gateways, customer support, and more. You can also create custom integrations specific to your brand.\n\n## Feature 1: Digital Gift Cards\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2023-01-02\\_at\\_11.12.33\\_AM.png)\n\nNike allows customers to customize and purchase gift cards. They can be sent as a gift to an email or can be shipped as an actual card to a shipping address.\n\nMedusa allows creating gift cards with custom images, unlimited amounts, description, tags, and more.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2023-01-02\\_at\\_12.31.59\\_PM.png)\n\nMerchants can also specify for a specific denomination or amount the price for different currencies.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2023-01-02\\_at\\_12.32.27\\_PM.png)\n\nCustomers that purchase this gift card will have it delivered to their email and can use it during checkout.\n\nYou can also customize the experience by allowing customers to deliver the gift card to another person’s email. Gift cards in Medusa (and all entities) have a `metadata` attribute. This attribute can be used to store custom data.\n\nYou can utilize it to store a custom recipient email or shipping address, which would allow customers to send the gift card to their family or friends.\n\n```\nmetadata: {\n\trecipient_email: 'example@gmail.com'\n}\n```\n\n## Feature 2: Free Shipping for Members\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2023-01-02\\_at\\_11.49.01\\_AM.png)\n\nWhen taking a look at the features Nike provides, you’ll notice that their main focus is converting visitors and one-time customers to registered customers. This builds customer loyalty and increases the possibility of the customer making future purchases.\n\nOne way Nike encourages visitors to register and become members is offering free shipping for every order a member places. This makes registering worth the extra steps a customer have to make before placing an order, as they’ll be saving up on current and future orders.\n\nIn Medusa, this feature can be implemented with a combination of available features: [Customer Groups](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/customer-groups/), [Discounts](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/discounts/), and [Subscribers](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/subscribers/overview).\n\n### Customer Groups\n\nCustomer groups can be used to group together customers that share a similar set of attributes. Then, you can apply a different set of prices, discounts, and rules for customers belonging to that group.\n\nIn this use case, you can use customer groups to create the “Members” customer group. You’ll see later how to add customers to that group automatically on registration.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2023-01-02\\_at\\_12.31.09\\_PM.png)\n\n### Discounts\n\nDiscounts can be used to create discount codes that customers can use to save on their order. Discounts can be in the form of fixed discount amount, percentage discount amount, or free shipping.\n\nDiscounts can also have conditions. For example, you can specify which products this discount can be used on or which customer groups.\n\nTo implement the Free Shipping for Members feature, you can create a discount that gives customers belonging to the customer group “Members” free shipping on their orders.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2023-01-02\\_at\\_12.35.43\\_PM.png)\n\n### Subscribers\n\nThe last step required is to automatically:\n\n1.  Add customers to the Members customer group on registration.\n2.  Add the free shipping discount to customers of the Members customer group.\n\nIn Medusa, important actions trigger an event. Developers can listen or subscribe to events and perform an automated task when an action occurs. They do that using subscribers.\n\nStarting with adding customers to the Members customer group, you need to create a subscriber `src/subscribers/members.ts` on your Medusa server that subscribes to the `customer.created` event and adds the customer to the “Members” customer group:\n\n```\nimport { CustomerGroupService, CustomerService, EventBusService } from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\n\ntype InjectedProperties = {\n  eventBusService: EventBusService\n  customerService: CustomerService\n  customerGroupService: CustomerGroupService\n}\n\nclass MembersSubscriber {\n  customerService: CustomerService\n  customerGroupService: CustomerGroupService\n\n  constructor (container: InjectedProperties) {\n    this.customerService = container.customerService\n    this.customerGroupService = container.customerGroupService\n\n    container.eventBusService.subscribe('customer.created', this.handleRegistration)\n  }\n\n  handleRegistration = async (data) =\u003e {\n    //get Members customer group\n    const membersGroup = await this.customerGroupService.list({\n      name: 'Members'\n    }, { take: 1 })\n\n    if (!membersGroup.length) {\n      //Members group doesn't exist\n      return\n    }\n\n    //add customer to customer group\n    await this.customerGroupService.addCustomers(membersGroup[0].id, data.id)\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MembersSubscriber\n```\n\nNext, you need to create a subscriber that automatically adds the free shipping discount to members. The subscriber should subscribe to the events `cart.created` and `cart.customer_updated`. The first event is triggered when a new cart is created, and the second one is triggered whenever the customer associated with the cart is changed.\n\n```\nimport { CartService, EventBusService } from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\n\ntype InjectedDependencies = {\n  eventBusService: EventBusService\n  cartService: CartService\n}\n\nclass MemberDiscountSubscriber {\n  cartService: CartService\n  discountCode: string\n\n  constructor (container: InjectedDependencies) {\n    this.cartService = container.cartService\n    this.discountCode = 'MEMBERSFREESHIP'\n\n    container.eventBusService.subscribe('cart.created', this.handleDiscount)\n    container.eventBusService.subscribe('cart.customer_updated', this.handleDiscount)\n  }\n\n  handleDiscount = async (data) =\u003e {\n    const cartId = typeof data === 'string' ? data : data.id\n\n    this.cartService.update(cartId, {\n      discounts: [\n        {\n          code: this.discountCode\n        }\n      ]\n    })\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MemberDiscountSubscriber\n```\n\nNotice that in the code above, the discount code is hardcoded. This behavior can be changed to instead include it as an option or retrieve it in other ways using the `DiscountService`.\n\n## Feature 3: Search Suggestions and Auto Complete\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2023-01-02\\_at\\_1.39.50\\_PM.png)\n\nAn essential and often overlooked feature that ecommerce websites must perfect is the search functionalities. Customers generally visit an ecommerce website either exactly knowing what they want, or with an idea of what they want.\n\nNike does a great job at providing results for both types of customers. The moment the customer starts entering a search query, they can see top query suggestions and the best products that match the query.\n\nIf the customer knows what they’re looking for, they’ll find the product in the immediate results. If not, they can use the help of the top suggestions.\n\nIn Medusa, advanced search functionalities can be implemented by integrating the server to third-party services like [Algolia](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/algolia) or [MeiliSearch](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/meilisearch). This removes the need to implement these features from scratch, and allows utilizing best-in-brand services in your store.\n\n![](/images/gQVWvH2\\_h1ljig.png)\n\nBoth Algolia and MeiliSearch provide advanced features such as instantaneous search results, typo tolerance, search suggestions, autocomplete and more. You can integrate one of them by installing the service’s plugin on the Medusa server. Then, you can customize the UI on the storefront as you see fit for your customers.\n\n## Feature 4: Member-only Products\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2023-01-02\\_at\\_2.01.32\\_PM.png)\n\nSimilar to the free shipping feature, Nike also provides products that are only available for members or registered customers. This further encourages visitors to register and check out exclusive products.\n\nIn Medusa, this can be implemented with a combination of features: Customer Groups, Sales Channels, and Subscribers.\n\n### Customer Groups\n\nAs explained in an earlier section, members can be represented by a Customer Group called “Members”. You would then need to implement automatically assigning the Members customer groups to registered customers, as explained earlier.\n\n### Sales Channels\n\nSales channels allow customizing how and what products you sell for different channels in your store. Channels can be different platforms, such as website or mobile. It can also be different types of customers, such as B2B customers or members.\n\nTo implement the Member-only products feature, you need to create a sales channel for Members. Then, you can make only specific products available in that sales channel and not available in the default channel.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2023-01-02\\_at\\_2.09.12\\_PM.png)\n\n### Subscribers\n\nThe last step is to create two subscribers that handle the following:\n\n1.  Add customers to the Members customer group on registration.\n2.  Assign the Members sales channel to members’ carts.\n\nThe first one’s implementation was explained earlier, and you can find the code block in a previous section.\n\nAs for the second, you need to create a subscriber that subscribes to the `cart.created` and the `cart.customer_updated` events. If the customer associated with the cart belongs to the Members customer group, the Members sales channel is associated with the cart. Otherwise, the default channel is associated with the cart.\n\n```\nimport { CartService, EventBusService, SalesChannel, SalesChannelService } from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\n\ntype InjectedDependencies = {\n  eventBusService: EventBusService\n  cartService: CartService\n  salesChannelService: SalesChannelService\n}\n\nclass MemberDiscountSubscriber {\n  cartService: CartService\n  salesChannelService: SalesChannelService\n\n  constructor (container: InjectedDependencies) {\n    this.cartService = container.cartService\n    this.salesChannelService = container.salesChannelService\n\n    container.eventBusService.subscribe('cart.created', this.handleCreate)\n    container.eventBusService.subscribe('cart.customer_updated', this.handleCreate)\n  }\n\n  handleCreate = async (data) =\u003e {\n    const cartId = typeof data === 'string' ? data : data.id\n\n    //retrieve default sales channel\n    const defaultChannel = await this.salesChannelService.retrieveByName('Default Sales Channel') as SalesChannel\n\n    //retrieve sales channel\n    const membersChannel = await this.salesChannelService.retrieveByName('Members') as SalesChannel\n\n    if (!membersChannel) {\n      //sales channel does not exist\n      return\n    }\n\n    //retrieve cart\n    const cart = await this.cartService.retrieve(cartId, {\n      relations: ['customer', 'customer.groups']\n    })\n\n    const isMember = cart.customer?.groups.some((group) =\u003e group.name === 'Members')\n    \n    await this.cartService.update(cartId, {\n      sales_channel_id: isMember ? membersChannel.id : defaultChannel.id\n    })\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MemberDiscountSubscriber\n```\n\n## Feature 5: Birthday Deals\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2023-01-02\\_at\\_3.21.29\\_PM.png)\n\nAnother member benefit that Nike offers is birthday deals. If a member registers before their birthday, they’ll receive a discount on their birthday. Nike emails them with details about the discount.\n\nThis can be implemented in Medusa using a combination of features: Customer Groups, and Scheduled Jobs. The usage of customer groups is as explained in earlier sections.\n\n### Scheduled Jobs\n\nMedusa allows developers to schedule a task to run at a specific time using scheduled jobs. In this context, a scheduled job can be used to run every day at midnight. Then, it checks which customers’ birthday is set to today. For those customers, an email is sent with the deal details.\n\nYou can make use of the `metadata` field to store custom fields such as `birthday`. You’ll need to save it when the customer registers or allow the customer to set their birthday in their profile.\n\n```\nconst checkBirthdaysJob = async (container, options) =\u003e {\n  const jobSchedulerService = container.resolve(\"jobSchedulerService\");\n  jobSchedulerService.create(\"check-birthdays\", {}, \"0 0 * * *\", async () =\u003e {\n    //job to execute\n    const customerService = container.resolve(\"customerService\");\n    const customers = await this.customerService.list({\n      metadata: {\n        birthday: Date.now().toString()\n      }\n    })\n\n\t\tcustomers.forEach((customer) =\u003e {\n\t\t\t//create discount/gift card\n\t\t\t//and send email\n\t\t})\n  })\n}\n\nexport default checkBirthdaysJob;\n```\n\nThe deal can be implemented either using Discounts or Custom Gift Cards. For the first option, you create a discount with a random code and send it to the customer. For the second option, you create a custom gift card with an amount, and send the gift card’s code to the customer.\n\nTo send the email to the customer, you’ll need to integrate a third-party plugin such as [SendGrid](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/sendgrid).\n\n## Do More with Medusa\n\nThe features explored in this article aim to provide a better user experience for customers.

Its architecture is made of three main components:\n\n*   The server: a headless backend that handles all the business logic and data related to the ecommerce store. It can be connected to any frontend for both the storefront and the admin.\n*   The storefront: this is the interface that customers use to browse the ecommerce store and make their purchase. We provide a Next.js and Gatsby starter storefronts, but developers have the freedom to create their own by connecting to the storefront REST APIs.\n*   The admin: this is the interface that merchants use to manage their ecommerce store’s settings and data. We provide a Medusa admin that provides all necessary and advanced functionalities, but developers are free to create their own by connecting to the admin REST APIs.\n\nYou can learn more about Medusa’s features and architecture in [the documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/introduction).\n\n## Why we decided to improve our documentation\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, our documentation provided developers with the basic information they needed to run Medusa. Although this was good enough to get them started, it wasn’t enough to guide them through the entire process of developing an ecommerce store.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2022-12-23\\_at\\_10.37.37\\_AM.png)\n\nThere were improvements needed regarding the content, the design, the feedback collected, and more. To provide these improvements, we needed to change how we handle our documentation and add more resources into developing it.\n\n## How we improved the documentation\n\n### View the documentation as a product\n\nThe most essential change that helped us implement all improvements is how we manage the documentation. In most software companies, documentation has less of a priority compared to the software, and it is handled as an afterthought.\n\nAt Medusa, we early on came to realize that documentation is what can actually drive further adoption of Medusa.\n\nDevelopers that are curious would be sufficient with a [quickstart](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start) guide. However, those who actually want to use Medusa to create an ecommerce store for themselves or for their clients require the documentation to explain different concepts and how to implement them.\n\nBy recognizing that the documentation is a product, we were able to:\n\n*   Recognize priorities for what changes/additions should be made for the documentation. These priorities can be decided on based on company goals, our roadmap, improvements in user experience, and more.\n*   Plan our work in cycles. We now use [Linear](https://linear.app/) to manage our documentation cycles, tasks, and backlog.\n*   Involve the design team and other teams to further improve our documentation and the experience we provide.\n*   Be more in sync with the core engineering team to deliver changes to the documentation along with changes in the product. The core engineering team also uses Linear, so both teams can be informed of the work they’re each doing, which allows us to stay in sync.\n\n### Refactored our API Reference\n\nOur previous API reference needed serious improvements related to:\n\n*   Maintaining it to ensure that all the details in it were updated with continuous releases.\n*   Providing a good user experience, as it was slow and provided minimal information.\n*   Offering examples on how to use and run endpoints.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2022-12-23\\_at\\_11.31.11\\_AM.png)\n\nTo improve it, we decided that it needed to be fully refactored, both in how it was being generated and in how the website itself was built.\n\nThe [API reference](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store/)’s OpenAPI Spec is now generated with every new release, ensuring that it’s never outdated. We also added in the OpenAPI Spec comments in our code (which are used to generate the API reference) examples of running requests with the Medusa JS Client and cURL. In addition, we added examples of expected request or response parameters and of possible errors.\n\nThe website was previously built with Gatsby using a custom theme. As part of the refactor, we changed it to run as part of our [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) main documentation and on top of [Redocly](https://redocly.com/) using the [Redocusaurus](https://github.com/rohit-gohri/redocusaurus) plugin.\n\nThis allowed us to utilize Redocly’s functionalities and features that are tailored towards building API references. This further improves the developer experience.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Recording\\_2022-12-23\\_at\\_11.40.05\\_AM.gif)\n\n### Completely redesigned the documentation\n\nIn the last quarter of 2022, we focused on redesigning the documentation to:\n\n*   Improve the user and developer experience of our documentation.\n*   Restructure the homepage to guide developers to the essential concepts and guides in Medusa.\n*   Provide a design that is fitting with our brand identity.\n\nThanks to our design team, we were able to introduce a clean design, a summarized homepage with the essential documentation on how to use Medusa, and improve on existing components used throughout the documentation.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2022-12-23\\_at\\_11.42.48\\_AM.png)\n\n### Collect user feedback\n\nAn important part of developing any product, including the documentation, is to ensure that your users are actually benefiting from the additions or changes you’re making. We implemented that in different ways.\n\nOne way was to include a feedback component at the end of all documentation pages or after certain steps that allows developers to let us know whether they found the content helpful or not, and what could be improved.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2022-12-23\\_at\\_11.48.00\\_AM.png)\n\nThis helped us find errors in the documentation that we missed or opportunities to make the documentation clearer.\n\nFurthermore, for each code block, we added a report button. This allows developers to quickly create an issue on GitHub with information on the problem they faced while using that code block.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2022-12-23\\_at\\_11.50.07\\_AM.png)\n\nThere’s also a link to report issues in the navigation bar that developers can use at any point while browsing the documentation. This further helps us eliminate issues and errors quickly.\n\n### Integrate Vale and ESLint into the Documentation\n\nStyle guides are important as it helps maintain a single tone throughout the documentation. It is key to be consistent in how you write the documentation, as developers get used to it while browsing it.\n\nHowever, it’s one thing to write down a style guide, and another thing to actually apply and enforce it. As humans, we can easily miss certain things, especially for written content. This is especially the case with open source projects, as you have many contributors that look forward to help, but may not know how to follow the style guide.\n\nSimilar to how a software has integration or unit tests that are built to make sure changes in the software don’t break the entire system, we implemented tests for our documentation’s style guide using [Vale](https://vale.sh/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).\n\nVale allows you to define a set of rules for your documentation’s textual content. Then, when ran against your documentation files (such as Markdown files), it shows you any errors in the content based on your rules.\n\nESLint allows you to check for errors and enforce a programming style for JavaScript. Using plugins, it can be integrated with other languages and formats. Using the [eslint-plugin-markdown plugin](https://github.com/eslint/eslint-plugin-markdown), we were able to check for errors and inconsistencies in code blocks within the documentation.\n\nWe also integrated both tools into our documentation pipeline by ensuring that their tests run on every documentation pull request (PR) in our GitHub repository.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2022-12-23\\_at\\_11.57.22\\_AM.png)\n\n### Run User Trials\n\nCollecting user feedback is helpful. However, in order to provide a good developer experience, you need to learn how your developers are actually using your documentation.\n\nThe best way to do that is to monitor them using it while performing a task. To do this, we started user trials for our documentation. Every quarter, we’ll run a user trial revolving around a specific task and monitor how participants perform that task.\n\nThis is essential when you introduce a new feature into your documentation and want to see how developers use it. Is it actually a good feature? What improvements are needed to make it better?\n\nThis is also a good exercise to see what problems developers might run into, how the content or the information architecture can be misleading, and whether we really understand our documentation users or not.\n\nIf you’re interested in helping us improve our documentation, [learn more about our user trials and how you can become a participant](https://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/bFCQpY59).\n\n## What’s next?\n\nWriting this article does not mean we have the best documentation out there, and the journey to improve our documentation doesn’t end here. It’s an ongoing process and collaboration between our different teams and the community behind Medusa. The goal is to ensure that we understand our developers and make the information they need accessible.\n\nWhat do you think of our improvements on the documentation?

It provides a limited number of products, but each product is complex and has a lot of details.\n\nAlso, each product comes with a manual that allows customers to figure out whether the product fits their needs or not.\n\nThis article explores some of Massey Ferguson’s powerful UX, such as:\n\n*   Intuitive and Smooth Navigation: provide the navigation that helps your customers find what they need.\n*   Summarized Product Section on The Homepage: the homepage is typically the first page your customers will see. Utilize it to show your customers what your store offers.\n*   Highlighted Promotions: motivate your customers to purchase by emphasizing the promotions you offer.\n\n## 1- Intuitive and Smooth Navigation\n\nYour website navigation menu is the key to success in your ecommerce website. The easier and more engaging your navigation experience is, the easier it will be for customers to find what they need.\n\nSome good navigation tips that Massey Ferguson applies:\n\n*   In the products dropdown menu, customers can see the main two categories at the top of the menu and can select one of them based on what exactly they looking for.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-11-29\\_at\\_10.27.52\\_PM.png)\n\n*   When a customer hovers over one of the subcategories, the product names under these subcategories are shown next to the main category. This gives the customer a glimpse of the available products before diving into a category and helps narrow their options.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-11-30\\_at\\_10.49.05\\_AM.png)\n\n*   Similarly, when the customer hovers over a product’s name, the product’s image and details are shown in the menu. Customers can easily navigate between available products before deciding on which one fits their needs.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-11-29\\_at\\_10.06.56\\_PM.png)\n\n## 2- Summarized Product Section on The Homepage\n\nAs the homepage is most likely the first page a customer will see of your website, you can utilize it to show a selection of your store’s products.\n\nFor B2B ecommerce websites, the homepage should show the customer what this store specializes in and the overall available products and options.\n\nMassey Ferguson utilizes the homepage to showcase their available products by doing the following:\n\n*   Customers can see the main categories on the home page as filters. They can choose between the available categories to get a quick overview of the available products under that category.\n\n![](/images/ezgif.com-gif-maker%20\\(3\\).gif)\n\n*   Quick view to view more information for all products in the grid, or per product instead of viewing the product page. Other information can serve as a significant motivator for different types of customers, so Include information extras that will nudge customers to purchase.\n\n*   The products’ main details can be easily viewed right from the homepage by toggling the Quick View option. Customers can easily find what they’re looking for without leaving the home page.\n\n![](/images/ezgif.com-gif-maker%20\\(4\\).gif)\n\n*   Product details are shown as short details with clear icons. Customers can easily scan the details of the products in seconds.\n\n## 3- Highlighted Promotions\n\nB2B customers come to your store with specific products in mind, but promotions are always appealing. It’s important to properly highlight your promotions, as it catches the customer’s eye immediately.\n\nMassey Ferguson does a good job of highlighting its promotions:\n\n*   Promotions are shown in the hero section, which is the first section of the website that the customer sees.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-12-01\\_at\\_11.32.28\\_AM.png)\n\n*   On the Offers page, promotions are shown with an expiry date. This urges customers to quickly purchase before the promotion ends.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-12-01\\_at\\_12.02.40\\_PM.png)\n\n*   The offer details are noticeable, and the time of the offer is spotlighted on the product card, to ensure that all customers are aware of the promotions details and it’s impossible to miss. Also, it’s easy to check more details by clicking the “Find out more” button which opens the details on the same page and that doesn't distract the customer by navigate between pages.\n*   For each promotion, its details and expiry date are shown in the offers list. Customers can check if there are any promotions for the products they want to purchase directly from the list.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-12-01\\_at\\_12.06.50\\_PM.png)\n\n## Build your B2B Store with Medusa\n\nWith Medusa, the open-source B2B platform, build your ecommerce store to include all these features and more.

[Top 5 B2B Ecommerce sites: Massey Ferguson (5/5)](https://medusajs.com/blog/top-5-b2b-ecommerce-sites-massey-ferguson)\n\n## Medusa’s UX and B2B Focus\n\n[Medusa](https://medusajs.com/) provides bespoke commerce infrastructure through its composable commerce platform. Its extendible and open setup makes it well-suited to support cases that require setup flexibility and is easy to customize.\n\nMedusa’s headless architecture makes it possible to build bespoke storefronts that can be optimized to provide a great UX, leading to customer conversion. This is needed in a B2B setting, where most stores are not set up well to cater to the particular needs of a B2B customer.\n\nIf you’d like to know more about our product and how we serve B2B users, feel free to visit our [B2B page](https://medusajs.com/b2b-commerce-platform/).\n\n## Blake\n\n[Blake](https://www.blake-envelopes.com/) is a market leader in the world of paper, envelope, and postal packaging solutions. Blake's B2B ecommerce has a well-designed homepage, an accessible menu, and direct access to brands, colors, and product specifications.\n\nBlake’s product pages include detailed descriptions and different options to order. Overall, it focuses on attracting customers by providing them with seamless features.\n\nThis article explores some of Blake’s powerful UX, such as:\n\n*   Clean and Clear Menus: design the layout of your menus to make it easy for customers to find the categories they’re looking for.\n*   Informative product pages: provide your B2B customers with all the information they need, encouraging them to purchase.\n*   Next-level filters: allow your customers to filter beyond the filters. Allow them to navigate their way through your products list to find what they need.\n\n## 1- Clean and Clear Menus\n\nB2B customers often know the exact specifications of the product they want and just want to find it as quickly as possible on your site.\n\nYour B2B ecommerce website should make it easy for customers to scan available products and categories to find what they need efficiently.\n\nSome examples of how Blake does this:\n\n*   The typography and spacing used between different elements, products, and categories, make it easier for the customer to scan available products or categories to find what they need.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-12-04\\_at\\_11.02.43\\_AM.png)\n\n*   The available options in the menu are grouped into related sets. For each group, concise and descriptive labels are used.\n\n*   Customers have the choice to navigate available products using sizes, types, colors, or brands.\n\n*   Different designs for different mega menus, depending on the top category, the menu shows up in different styles and different types of links to promote customers for what matters in this category.\n\n*   Mega menus are designed differently based on what products are available in the top category of that menu. Customers browsing these menus get a glance of important items in that category.\n\n![](/images/ezgif.com-gif-maker%20\\(2\\).gif)\n\n## 2- Informative Product Pages\n\nThe product page should be simple and not stuffed with too much information. This allows the customer to properly focus on the product and its properties.\n\nSome ways that Blake does this:\n\n*   Product images are of high quality and can be zoomed in, which gives the customer a closer and more realistic look at the product. For products like those that Blake provides, this is essential as customers can almost get the textual feeling of the products.\n*   Provide a brief and informed description next to the image and below provide detailed product information in the table. the descriptions are a key area here so clear, well-written product descriptions that help customers to choose the product is the right fit.\n*   Products have a brief description at the top of the page, but more details are shown in a table below it. Customers can use the description to learn the general details of the product, then, if they’re interested, browse the more detailed table.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-12-04\\_at\\_2.20.08\\_PM.png)\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-12-04\\_at\\_2.20.01\\_PM.png)\n\n*   Breadcrumbs are available at the top of the product page. It helps the customer understand where they are on the website, as well as what category they’re browsing.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-12-04\\_at\\_2.14.25\\_PM.png)\n\n*   Customers have different purchasing options, either by the pack or by units. This gives B2B customers freedom while ordering and allows them to easily order large quantities.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Recording\\_2022-12-04\\_at\\_02.26.03\\_PM-c3f23c9b.gif)\n\n*   If customers register, they can request a sample or get help from Blake’s sales team when ordering large quantities. This encourages customers to register.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-12-04\\_at\\_2.35.44\\_PM.png)\n\n## 3- Next-Level Filters\n\nProduct filters are one of the essential elements impacting your customers’ user experience. Optimizing your product filters increase customer engagement.\n\nSome practices that Blake applies in their product filters:\n\n*   Next to filters, the number of products under that filter is shown. This gives the customer an idea of the results they’ll get before applying the filter.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot%202022-12-21%20at%202.59.04%20PM.png)\n\n*   Customers can see all available categories in the filter. When a filter is applied, not only the products are updated, but the filters as well based on the remaining products. This makes the customer’s browsing experience seamless.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-12-04\\_at\\_9.41.11\\_PM.png)\n\n*   The selected filters are shown at the top of the filter list and can be easily cleared. Customers can navigate between different sets of filters by just clearing applied filters, then applying new ones.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-12-04\\_at\\_9.50.12\\_PM.png)\n\n*   The short filter list saves customers time and makes filtering less frustrating for them.\n\n## Build your B2B Store with Medusa\n\nWith Medusa, the open-source B2B platform, build your ecommerce store to include all these features and more.

It offers more than enough quality information on its products via descriptions and images. It efficiently provides customers with all the details they need.\n\nThis article explores some of Amy Myers MD’s powerful UX, such as:\n\n*   Great on-site search experience: utilize your search bar to provide your customers with the results they’re looking for.\n*   Seamless cart and checkout flow: provide your customer with the necessary features to encourage them further toward purchase.\n*   Effective product-listing page: showcase your products in the best light, with enough information to build up the customer’s curiosity.\n\n## 1- Optimized Search Experiences\n\nIn B2B, website search is crucial. B2B customers often already know what they want to purchase and need the ability to quickly and easily find what they are looking for. A good search UX would allow the customer to do just that.\n\nSome of the features that they implemented to provide a good search experience:\n\n*   On the website, customers can choose to search from different domains of the website such as the store, help center, and more.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-11-21\\_at\\_4.16.29\\_PM.png)\n\n*   Once the customer starts writing the query, they can see the result in a drop-down menu. The results show a photo and the price along with the title. This helps the customers to make an informed decision.\n\n![](/images/ezgif.com-gif-maker%20\\(1\\)-914c672a.gif)\n\n*   On the search results page, if the product name includes words from the search query, these words are highlighted. This allows the customer to focus on products that are potentially more accurate for their query.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-11-21\\_at\\_4.23.55\\_PM.png)\n\n*   There is a search bar in the middle of the home page. This search bar shows trending searches on the website. That increases the customer’s curiosity to know more about products and might encourage them to purchase.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-11-30\\_at\\_4.44.34\\_PM.png)\n\n*   The search bar is sticky at the top of the page so customers can search no matter where they are down the page.\n\n## 2- Seamless Cart and Checkout Flow\n\nThe shopping cart and checkout pages are major deciding factors in making customers satisfied and reducing abandonment. It can also increase customer loyalty as they’ll feel more comfortable purchasing from your store again.\n\nSome of the good UX that Amy Myers MD implements:\n\n*   Customers can check out as guests. This makes the purchasing process faster and easier. The less steps a customer has to take to place an order, the higher the chance they’ll go through until the end of the process.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-11-30\\_at\\_2.52.05\\_PM.png)\n\n*   Customers can switch between one-time purchases and subscription purchases of products directly from the cart.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Recording\\_2022-12-06\\_at\\_12.34.33\\_PM.gif)\n\n*   Customers can see how many points they can earn after they purchase the order if they have an account. This can encourage customers to register and purchase more in the future.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-12-06\\_at\\_12.48.12\\_PM.png)\n\n*   Customers can start their checkout experience directly from the navigation bar, as a checkout button is available next to the cart. The checkout button is also designed in a way that catches the customer’s eye.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-11-30\\_at\\_3.04.12\\_PM.png)\n\n*   On the checkout page, customers can see some recommended products under the shopping list. The products have a rating score to encourage customers to purchase them.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-11-30\\_at\\_4.06.21\\_PM.png)\n\n## 3- Effective Product Listing Pages\n\nThe product listing display has a significant impact on the way your customers interact with the products. It can boost your B2B ecommerce website’s UX.\n\nSome of the good practices that this website applies:\n\n*   The grid view and the spaces between cards are easy on the eyes. It allows customers to browse and compare products.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-12-03\\_at\\_7.38.24\\_PM-5001fd88.png)\n\n*   When a customer hovers over a product image, they can see a review left by other customers that have purchased the product. This encourages the customer to see the product’s details and learn more about it.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Recording\\_2022-12-03\\_at\\_06.10.20\\_PM.gif)\n\n*   Products on sale are labeled with a tag on the product card. Customers can also see the prices before and after the sale, and how much they’ll save.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-12-03\\_at\\_6.04.30\\_PM.png)\n\n## Build your B2B Store with Medusa\n\nWith Medusa, the open-source B2B platform, build your ecommerce store to include all these features and more.

Its extendible and open setup makes it well-suited to support cases that require setup flexibility and is easy to customize.\n\nMedusa’s headless architecture makes it possible to build bespoke storefronts that can be optimized to provide a great UX, leading to customer conversion. This is needed in a B2B setting, where most stores are not set up well to cater to the particular needs of a B2B customer.\n\nIf you’d like to know more about our product and how we serve B2B users, feel free to visit our [B2B page](https://medusajs.com/b2b-commerce-platform/).\n\n# Grainger\n\n[Grainger](https://www.grainger.com/) is an industrial supplier that offers a large selection of private-label and brand-name products from some of the world’s top manufacturers.\n\nWith Grainger, customers can place bulk orders quickly and seamlessly. The main focus is on all-inclusive categorization. Customers can easily filter categories to narrow down their options.\n\nThis article explores some of Grainger’s powerful UX, such as:\n\n*   Well-organized categories: assist your customers in finding exactly what they need from the first scan.\n*   B2B-focused Shopping Experience: understand your customers and implement the necessary features that convert visitors to customers.\n*   Powerful search experience: provide the customer with different options that lead to the results they’re looking for.\n\n## 1- Well-Organized Categories\n\nGood categorization helps customers find what they need quickly. When a customer is looking for a specific product, they’ll try to find the category that this product could fit into.\n\nEnsuring that your B2B ecommerce website’s categories are clearly outlined and showcase enough information about their underlying products will help your customers find what they require easily.\n\nGrainger does a good job at this by doing the following:\n\n*   On the homepage, popular categories are shown in a grid layout. Each category has a name and a large icon that gives an idea of what products are available in the category. This makes it easier for customers to scan and find the category they’re looking for.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-11-29\\_at\\_10.36.14\\_PM.png)\n\n*   All available categories can also be browsed on a dedicated Product Categories page. Customers can use this page in case they don’t find what they require among the categories on the homepage.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-11-29\\_at\\_10.36.36\\_PM.png)\n\n*   Every category level has a detailed description. This helps the customer understand more about what the category is and what they can find in it.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Recording\\_2022-11-30\\_at\\_12.47.41\\_PM.gif)\n\n*   Categories can also be browsed directly from the mega menu in the navigation bar. They are sorted in alphabetical order, making it easy to scan and find something specific.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-11-30\\_at\\_1.24.32\\_PM.png)\n\n## 2- B2B-focused Shopping Experience\n\nB2B ecommerce websites should streamline the shopping and checkout experience to ensure their visitors are converted to customers, and one-time customers to returning customers.\n\nThis can be done by carefully planning and designing the shopping experience based on your customers. Provide the features that would increase the possibility of your customer placing an order.\n\nGrainger offers some good features that show an understanding of their B2B customers, including:\n\n*   The Add To Cart button in the Recently Viewed Products section on the homepage, is noticeable and attention-grabbing to the primary action you want the customer to take.\n*   Recently viewed products are shown on the homepage. Each of these products has an Add to Cart button. This can help customers look back to what they were interested in, and consider it for purchase.\n\n![](/images/ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif)\n\n*   Bulk order is a superpower for B2B ecommerce websites. Customers can enter the SKU of the product and its quantity, and it’ll be directly added to the cart. Grainger provides this feature directly in the navigation bar. This facilitates the shopping experience of returning customers and encourages them to make more purchases.\n\n![](/images/ezgif.com-gif-maker%20\\(1\\).gif)\n\n*   Customers can quickly access a summary of a product’s details from the product's listing page. They can also directly add the product to the cart from that same page.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-12-01\\_at\\_1.25.18\\_PM.png)\n\n## 3- Powerful Search Experience\n\nAs B2B websites generally offer a large set of products with different details and attributes, it’s important to provide a search experience that allows the customer to find the products they’re looking for.\n\nMaking your search experience powerful is more than just showing the correct results for a search query. It’s providing options to narrow down the results, suggestions for better results, and more.\n\nGrainger provides their customers with the following features to enhance their search experience:\n\n*   The search bar placeholder informs the customer what keywords or attributes they can search products by, such as model or part number. This clarifies to the customer what they can look for with the search bar.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-12-03\\_at\\_3.54.20\\_PM.png)\n\n*   As the customer enters their query, they see real-time keyword suggestions, recommended products, and search results for products, product categories, and brands. Each of these helps the customer narrow down the available results to what they need.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-12-03\\_at\\_3.06.23\\_PM.png)\n\n*   Customers can quickly add the items from the search result to the cart. They can input the quantity and click the Add to Cart button. This is especially helpful for customers that already know what specific item they want.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Recording\\_2022-12-03\\_at\\_03.53.29\\_PM.gif)\n\n*   Save customer search history, which personalizes the search experience and makes the customer reach quickly to products that usually purchase.\n*   The customer’s search history is saved and shown when the customer clicks the search bar. If the customer has previously conducted a search and wants to look through the results again, this helps them find the results again easily.\n\n## Build your B2B Store with Medusa\n\nWith Medusa, the open-source B2B platform, build your ecommerce store to include all these features and more.

In this regard, we are particularly interested to showcase how a headless setup allows developers to build fine-tuned storefronts using the case of McMaster-Carr.\n\nIf you’d like to know more about our product and how we serve B2B users, feel free to visit [medusajs.com/b2b-commerce-platform](https://medusajs.com/b2b-commerce-platform/)\n\n## What is McMaster-Carr?\n\nMcMaster-Carr is a business-to-business (B2B) industrial supply company founded in 1901. Their website has been around since the early days of the internet and continues to be a popular place for businesses and hobbyists to buy hardware and accessories.\n\nIn fact, a post titled “[Mcmaster.com](http://Mcmaster.com) is the best e-commerce site I've ever used” recently trended on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32976978). What seemed like an innocuous statement ended up receiving over 490 comments as people discussed the merits of the B2B ecommerce businesses alongside personal anecdotes from using it.\n\n## Why the McMaster-Carr Website Has the Best Ecommerce UX\n\nThe McMaster-Carr website is indeed an excellent one and stands out; here’s how they’ve helped create the best UX for their customers:\n\n### 1. Seamless Customer Journey\n\nToday’s online shopping experiences are rife with distractions: pop-up ads with coupon codes, hero sections advertising new deals and steals, and product carousels with upselling and cross-selling recommendations.\n\nMcMaster-Carr shoppers don’t encounter distractions; you can see proof of this on the homepage which jumps right into the action:\n\n![](/images/mcmaster-carr-distracton-free-home-page.png)\n\nIn addition, the designers have done a great job in minimizing the number of landing pages shoppers have to visit before buying something.\n\nAs a result, they’ve reduced the number of clicks their shoppers have to make from the point of entry to conversion. This reduced workload makes the website feel easier to use. It also means they get their shopping done more quickly.\n\n### 2. Uncluttered UI\n\nMcMaster-Carr currently has over 700,000 products in its store. That amount of inventory alone would be enough to overwhelm some shoppers. That’s why it’s crucial that the design and layout of the store be as uncluttered and straightforward as possible.\n\nMany of the best ecommerce UX these days have well-laid-out architectures. The main difference between those stores and McMaster’s is the level of detail put into the user interface (UI).\n\nYou won’t find eye-catching gradients, fun animations, or anything like that here. The visual design of the McMaster-Carr website more closely resembles a detailed yet raw-looking wireframe than it does a fully fleshed-out and branded store.\n\nConsidering this is an industrial supply store, the lowkey UI design makes a lot of sense. Hardware doesn’t need to be pretty in order to be effective. This frill-less design keeps visual distractions at bay so shoppers can focus on the products and their specifications.\n\n![](/images/mcmaster-carr-user-interface-design.png)\n\nFor example, colors are kept to a minimum. In addition, the images are all presented in greyscale. This basic color palette and presentation of images make it easy for shoppers to focus on product details instead of getting caught up in flashy design choices on the site.\n\n### 3. Sticky Left-Side Navigation\n\nThe placement and design of the navigation matter a good deal. On most ecommerce websites, you’ll find the navigation inside of the header, with each top-level product category spread out across the width of it. Shoppers can then hover over each category to explore sub-categories of products.\n\nMcMaster-Carr’s designers have handled this much differently. The navigation is a sticky sidebar that sits alongside the left rail of the website. It can also be accessed by clicking the “BROWSE CATALOG” hamburger menu button in the top-left corner.\n\nThis design is beneficial. There’s been no compromise in terms of which product categories get top billing. All of them are present. Not only that, the categories fit without forcing shoppers to scroll.\n\n![](/images/mcmaster-carr-sidebar-navigation.gif)\n\n### 4. Effective Header Design\n\nWhile navigation is a primary component of the online shopping UX, it often takes up so much room that other important elements are sidelined. Thanks to sticky sidebar navigation, McMaster-Carr’s header design isn’t weighed down by product category links.\n\nInstead, what shoppers find is a light, airy website header design where it’s easy to find all the important tools they need.\n\n![](/images/mcmaster-carr-header-design.png)\n\nThe different header components are sized and styled based on importance. For example, the search bar is about a third of the width of the header. Its prominent size ensures that shoppers can quickly find and use it when they have something specific they are shopping for.\n\n### 5. Smart Site Search\n\nThe importance of the search bar cannot be understated in ecommerce. Without it, the online shopping experience would be more time-consuming and stressful than it often already is.\n\nThat said, stores the size and complexity of McMaster-Carr need to equip shoppers with advanced search functionality — one that can fix any spelling errors and predict what they’re searching for.\n\n![](/images/mcmaster-carr-site-search.gif)\n\nWithout a smart search feature, shoppers would likely run into a ton of stumbling blocks. Not only does this search bar fix entry errors, but it provides alternative matching results. This maximizes the chances that shoppers will find exactly what they’re looking for the first time they search for it.\n\nWhat’s more, results don’t just get updated in the search’s dropdown bar. They get updated on the page, providing shoppers with even more results and product sub-categories to consider.\n\n### 6. Helpful Search Filters\n\nThe search bar and navigation are the entry point into the McMaster-Carr shopping experience. They alone won’t get shoppers where they need to go, which is why the filters sidebar is needed.\n\nRegardless of which tool shoppers use to get there, the left-aligned filters sidebar will help them whittle down their product search results page. This is yet another way in which the designers have streamlined the shopping experience.\n\n![](/images/mcmaster-carr-product-filters.gif)\n\nScroll through the filters and you’ll notice these don’t look like your typical ecommerce controls.\n\nFor example, you won’t find sliders, which can be unwieldy depending on how large of a dataset you’re trying to pick a number from. What’s more, when scrollable lists of data are presented, a mini search bar is always present at the top as a shortcut to scrolling.\n\nThese filters enhance an already streamlined ecommerce UX. With descriptive matching visuals, companion search bars, and easy-to-find clickable links, these filters make shopping on McMaster-Carr a breeze.\n\n### 7. Simplified Content\n\nOne of the problems with modern ecommerce design is the idea that a product page needs to be long. Product images dominate above the fold. Product descriptions and specifications sit just below the fold. Then there are sections for related product recommendations, product comparison tables, FAQs, customer reviews, and so on.\n\nThe longer the page becomes, the longer the decision-making process is going to take. And the longer those decisions take, the more chances there are for distractions and doubts to keep shoppers from converting.\n\nMcMaster-Carr’s product page design is a beautiful lesson in simplicity.\n\n![](/images/mcmaster-carr-simple-product-page-design.png)\n\nShoppers see:\n\n*   The product type\n\n*   Accompanying product photo\n\n*   Short description\n\n*   Table breaking down the specifications for each size\n\nIf shoppers want more details on the product type, they can expand the information provided under the accordion dropdowns at the top. If they want more information on the product specification, they can click the “Product Detail” button beneath to see more or to download the CAD file in their preferred format.\n\n![](/images/mcmaster-carr-product-detail-page.png)\n\nWith the way these pages are designed, there’s no need for users to scroll or to worry that they’re missing important details. It’s all clearly laid out in an easy-to-follow format.\n\n### 8. Custom Cart Page Design\n\nThe purpose of the cart page is to give shoppers the chance to review their items, make modifications, and add relevant notes before they check out. McMaster-Carr calls this page “ORDER” and it includes important features like:\n\n*   Field to enter the purchase order number\n\n*   Option to add reference info on each line\n\n*   Ability to convert to table view\n\n![](/images/mcmaster-carr-cart-page-design.png)\n\nThe one drawback about the way this cart page is designed — and how checkout is handled, in general — is that customers never get to see their true total costs. They can see the merchandise total on the right. However, shipping fees and taxes get added on post-purchase because of the way McMaster-Carr handles product fulfilment.\n\n### 9. Seamless Checkout Experience\n\nMany shoppers have come to expect the shopping cart page and ecommerce checkout flow to be two separate parts. It’s not necessarily done this way because it’s in the shoppers’ best interests. Instead, it’s usually because the ecommerce software generates the shopping cart while the payment gateway plugin creates the checkout flow.\n\nMcMaster-Carr’s website makes no distinction between the two. Instead, there is a seamless transition from the cart to checkout.\n\nShoppers log into their accounts on the right side of the “ORDERS” page. The checkout form then takes the place of the login form.\n\n![](/images/mcmaster-carr-checkout-form.gif)\n\nShoppers won't encounter a checkout page that looks foreign compared to the rest of the site. Nor will they have to deal with multi-step checkout flows. There’s a single form built right into the “ORDER” page where they:\n\n*   Choose the delivery method.\n\n*   Enter delivery address details.\n\n*   Provide payment information.\n\nThe form responds to every choice they make as well as to everything they input into the fields (if anything at all). This ensures that, when they’re ready to click the sticky “PLACE ORDER” button at the top, no errors occur.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWant to get more inspiration on UX best practices?

That’s wrong. A recent [McKinsey study](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/busting-the-five-biggest-b2b-e-commerce-myths) shows that 65% of B2B companies across industry sectors now offer ecommerce. In fact, ecommerce is becoming one of the main revenue channels for B2B.\n\n## Open source ecommerce platforms best serve the customization needs of B2B businesses\n\n![](/images/4\\_\\(1\\).png)\n\nBusinesses and their development teams benefit from open source platforms due to their flexibility. B2B commerce is complex as you need to handle aspects like customer groups, differentiated pricing, multiple integrations, and so on.\n\nThe flexibility of open source platforms makes them well-suited to handle these complexities as they can be better customized to individual business needs.\n\n## Open source and custom build ecommerce platforms are the preferred options among the top 250k ecommerce sites\n\n![](/images/3-5c391878.png)\n\nWe used [builtwith.com](http://builtwith.com) to categorize the checkout flows of the top 250k ecommerce sites online measured by traffic. **56% of the largest ecommerce sites online use an open source or custom build ecommerce platform.**\n\nThis is a strong testimony to the fact that as the complexity of businesses increases - as in the case of B2B - the greater the need is for flexibility and open architectures.\n\n## For open source platforms to be relevant, they need to support B2B-specific ecommerce features\n\n![](/images/5\\_\\(1\\).png)\n\nTo understand what open source ecommerce platforms best support B2B, we categorized the 10 most important features to support a modern B2B business.\n\nThis includes core features such as **Customer groups** to set up individual B2B customer rules, **Price lists** to differentiate pricing across customers, and **Sales channels** to separate B2B and B2C experiences.\n\nThese are some of the core features that B2B clients have requested from us in the past.\n\n## Overview of critical B2B features supported by existing open source platforms\n\n![](/images/6\\_\\(6\\)-dc2b0521.png)\n\nAt last, we looked at the most well-recognized open source platforms for B2B and compared them across the feature sets - [read the in-depth comparison here](https://medusajs.com/blog/top-5-open-source-ecommerce-platforms/).\n\nObviously, we built Medusa with this specific feature set in mind giving us an unfair advantage. However, it was still striking to see how many of the traditional B2B OS platforms failed to support elements we would consider core B2B functionality.\n\nThe research across competing platforms was undertaken by an independent researcher to ensure we got unbiased inputs.\n\n## Want more?\n\nDiscover more about B2B and open source ecommerce:\n\n*   Download our full Perspective presented above on our [B2B-page.](https://medusajs.com/b2b-commerce-platform)\n*   Check out our tutorial on how you set up Medusa to support B2B: [Part 1](https://medusajs.com/blog/medusa-b2b-part-1) \u0026 [Part 2](https://medusajs.com/blog/medusa-b2b-part-2).\n*   Reach out in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/medusajs) for a chat on the topic\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/top-5-open-source-ecommerce-platforms.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/top-5-open-source-ecommerce-platforms.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/top-5-open-source-ecommerce-platforms.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Best 5 Open Source Ecommerce Platforms for B2B","date":"2022-12-13","excerpt":"Get an overview of the available B2B features in the top 5 open source ecommerce platforms.","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/feature-by-feature (2).jpg","altText":"Top 5 open source ecommerce platforms for B2B: A feature-by-feature review","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"seo_description":"Get an overview of the available B2B features in the top 5 open source ecommerce platforms in this feature-by-feature review.","seo_keywords":"open source ecommerce, b2b ecommerce","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-osliwntg2.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-osliwntg2.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-osliwntg2.json"},"firstName":"Nicklas ","lastName":"Gellner","image":{"url":"/images/Nick.png","altText":"Nicklas Gellner"},"type":"Person"}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-a9wemp4po.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json"},"name":"Other","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"B2B ecommerce can be a complicated matter and imposes new requirements for an ecommerce platform compared to what is required to handle regular B2C commerce.\n\nGetting an overview of the B2B features that are supported out-of-the-box in the different open source solutions available in the market can likewise be challenging. Therefore, I spent some time together with [Carlos Padilla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlos-padilla-3a7679139/) researching:\n\n*   What are the 10 most critical features to support a scaleable B2B ecommerce setup?\n\n*   How well do the 5 most popular open source platforms compare across these features?\n\nBelow is a summary of the findings.\n\n![](/images/6\\_\\(4\\).png)\n\n## Why use open source for B2B commerce\n\n### What is an open source commerce platform\n\nBefore jumping into it, let’s get the definitions right.\n\n**Open source** refers to the source code of the platform being fully publicly available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute freely.\n\n**B2B ecommerce** refers to the direct sale of products or services between two businesses through an online sales portal. For instance, between a manufacturer and a wholesaler.\n\n### The benefits of open source commerce platforms\n\nBusinesses and their development teams often benefit from open source commerce platforms as they can take full control of the code base. This gives them the flexibility to build bespoke commerce setups.\n\nNewer open source commerce platforms have especially focused on the composability of the platform. This makes it possible for merchants to set up a tech stack of their preference while giving their development teams the possibility of mingling directly with the core to customize it to their preference. This is not possible with proprietary platforms.\n\nThis flexibility is the reason why the majority of the world’s top 250k ecommerce sites today use either open source or custom-built platforms to power their ecommerce setups. You can read more about this in [our recent Open Source B2B Ecommerce Perspective](https://medusajs.com/b2b-commerce-platform).\n\n### Why does flexibility matter for B2B businesses\n\nThe benefits of platform flexibility are only amplified in the world of B2B-oriented businesses.\n\nB2B is a complex area in commerce as you need to handle a lot of aspects that not considered in B2C. This includes customer groups, customer-differentiated pricing \u0026 discounts, separate B2B product catalogs, and more.\n\nIn addition, the integration landscape becomes more complex due to the need for integrations with ERP systems, more advanced fulfillment systems, new omnichannel experiences on the frontend, etc...\n\nThis requires flexible systems that are geared toward handling more bespoke cases. That is the reason why most B2B businesses end up building completely from scratch or hacking their setup together using a proprietary platform.\n\n## The 10 Most Important B2B Ecommerce Features\n\nFirst, we identified the 10 most important features to have for an ecommerce platform that needs to support B2B cases. We determined the features based on conversations with existing B2B ecommerce managers \u0026 developers, along with requirement specifications from our own B2B cases.\n\nBelow are the 10 features:\n\n*   **Customer groups** are a way to group customers with similar characteristics. This feature helps define unique B2B and custom logic for one particular subset of customers, for instance, specific pricing, promotions, or access levels.\n\n*   **Price lists** allow setting different B2B prices for different customer groups. This is used to add a sale or override the pricing of one or more products based on specific conditions.\n\n*   **Sales Channels** allow separating B2C and B2B customer experiences. Businesses can define different products for different channels. For example, B2B customers can see and purchase different products than B2C customers on the same interface.\n\n*   **Dynamic order management** allows businesses to perform granular order handling for B2B customers, including creating a new order on their behalf, adding payments, defining shipping addresses, or changing the order status.\n\n*   **Bulk imports** allow for the handling of larger B2B product catalogs by importing them from files, such as CSV files. Resources can be products, orders, customers, prices, etc…\n\n*   **Multi-currency support** enables B2B customers to order in their local currency catering to global B2B customers.\n\n*   **Payment flexibility** means the ability to configure different payment methods based on regional settings. This allows global B2B customers to choose the payment method that is available in their region.\n\n*   **Product configurations** allow merchants to associate unlimited custom attributes and options with their products. For a B2B case, the product catalog can get very complex. So, advanced product configurations provide additional information about a product to help customers make better purchase decisions.\n\n*   A**dvanced search** allows B2B customers with large catalogs to refine the search and discovery criteria and to display results quickly and accurately. Some advanced search strategies include typo tolerance, intuitive search, synonyms, keyword discovery, and faceted search.\n\n*   **Native headless ecommerce** refers to offering a solution where the frontend and backend of an ecommerce system are independent. From a B2B perspective, this allows businesses to offer omnichannel support by simultaneously developing different implementations for different channels. For example, developing a mobile application and a web app.\n\n**Legend**\n\n✅ = Supported\n\n☑️ = Supported via plugin\n\n❌ = Not supported\n\n## Medusa (JS/TS)\n\n*   ✅ **Customer groups** are available out-of-the-box and can be used for making discounts and promotions available for B2B wholesalers or retailer groups.\n\n*   ✅ **Price lists** are available out-of-the-box and allow you to specify custom pricing for each B2B customer group. Importing prices from a CSV file into a price list is available to better handle larger assortments.\n\n*   ✅ **Sales channels** allow you to manage order logistics and product data differently for each sales channel. You can create a B2B sales channel, specify which products are available in it, and process B2B orders in its own flow. You can do all of that from the same platform you manage B2C customers. At the moment of writing this, sales channels must be manually enabled using [feature flags](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/feature-flags/toggle/).\n\n*   ✅ The **dynamic order management** allows you to create manual draft orders, add existing or custom products as purchased items, and specify custom shipping amounts. Moreover, you can cancel the draft order or mark it as paid.\n\n*   ✅ **Bulk imports** for products and prices are available out-of-the-box; you can see the import process and check its status or cancel it. It's also effortless to extend the functionality to import other resources like orders or customers by [creating batch jobs](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/batch-jobs/create) with the Admin API.\n\n*   ✅ **Multi-currency support** is available out of the box; you can add multiple currencies and set product prices for each currency and region. Regions represent one or more countries and have their own currency. Customers can choose the region based on their currency and location.\n\n*   ✅ Medusa offers **payment flexibility** as you can specify which payment providers and methods are available for each region. Medusa offers plugins for [PayPal](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/paypal) and [Stripe](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/stripe), but there are many payment community plugins.\n\n*   ✅ Aside from basic product configuration such as general details or product collection, Medusa allows you to add **advanced product configurations** including unlimited options and variants, a metadata field to include any custom configurations, pricing per currency and region, and more.\n\n*   ☑️ In Medusa, **advanced search** can be implemented by integrating any search engine. Medusa offers official plugins for [Algolia](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/algolia) and [MeiliSearch](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/meilisearch). By integrating these powerful search engines, you can utilize their advanced search functionalities. When you add or update products on your Medusa server, the changes are reflected on the indices in the integrated search engine.\n\n*   ✅ Medusa is a flexible **headless commerce** platform with a backend that holds all the store's logic and data. It offers Admin and Store REST APIs to interact with the backend. It also offers an intuitive Medusa admin and Jamstack storefront starters.\n\n### Who should use Medusa\n\nMedusa covers nine of the ten features, leaving out only one feature you can add by using plugins.\n\nMedusa is one of the newest solutions on the market but has been used in production since 2018. It provides a powerful and flexible solution built on a composable architecture making it easy to customize the solution to specific user needs.\n\nBusinesses with a B2B ecommerce model should consider Medusa as it provides scalability, extendibility, and strong customization options. It’s also a powerful solution for developers preferring Node.js as it is the most used option in the Javascript and Typescript categories.\n\n## Magento (PHP)\n\n*   ✅ Magento uses **customer groups** to determine available discounts and taxes associated with the group. You can also set pricing rules for groups.\n\n*   ❌ **Prices lists** aren't offered, but it has catalog and cart price rules where you can apply discounts to specific products based on conditions. However, you can't override the price of products explicitly.\n\n*   ❌ The **sales channels** feature is not available in the open source version. This feature is available through extensions for Adobe Commerce but only supports specific sales channels such as Walmart or Amazon. However, it doesn't offer customizable sales channels.\n\n*   ✅ The **dynamic order management** lets you create manual orders from the Admin by selecting the customer and adding products. Also, you can fill up the order currency and apply coupon codes, payment, and shipping methods.\n\n*   ✅ **Bulk imports** are available out-of-the-box, allowing users to import many records in a single operation. They can import new products and update, replace, and delete existing sets of products.\n\n*   ✅ Magento supports **multi-currency** as it allows the ability to accept currencies from more than 200 countries worldwide. You can customize the currency symbols, change the displayed symbol of currencies, and import currency rates.\n\n*   ✅ **Payment flexibility** is supported by offering various offline methods such as cash on delivery, bank transfer payment, or check/money order methods that you can set for each store. For online methods, there are numerous integrations and gateways for third-party providers.\n\n*   ✅ You can edit the general product information and add media such as images or videos for **product configuration**. Also, you can customize product options and generate product variations with those options, and manage pricing and inventory.\n\n*   ✅ You must install and configure Elasticsearch or OpenSearch for a basic search or use the paid module Live search for an **advanced search**.\n\n*   ❌ Magento is not a **native headless commerce** platform. However, you can access its data through a REST API by making a new integration in the Admin panel or using the GraphQl API developed for the Storefront.\n\n### Who Should Use Magento\n\nMagento covers seven of ten parameters and lacks price lists, sales channels, and a native headless solution. Although Magento provides powerful ecommerce features, the lack of these important B2B features can make it an unfit platforms for B2B businesses.\n\nPutting the missing features aside, B2B ecommerce models can consider Magento if they need a centralized ecommerce system and want to be on the market fast. Also, they want a convenient website builder that meets all their needs, such as integrations or automated wholesale web applications.\n\n\u003e You can [read this article](https://medusajs.com/blog/medusa-vs-magento-comparing-two-open-source-ecommerce-frameworks/) to directly compare Medusa and Magento in terms of ecommerce features and developer experience.\n\n## Sylius (PHP)\n\n*   ✅ **Customer groups** are available by default and are used to attach cart promotions to offer a discount to customers that belong to specific groups. You can't add customers in bulk to a group.\n\n*   ❌ **Price lists** are not available since Sylius provides product prices per channel. Inside each product, you must set a current, an original, and a minimum price for each channel.\n\n*   ✅ The **sales channels** feature is available out of the box. You can configure general information, shop billing data, currencies and countries, and look and feel for each channel.\n\n*   ☑️ Sylius doesn't offer **dynamic order management** by default. However, there is an official plugin that allows administrators to create **manual orders**.\n\n*   ☑️ Sylius doesn't have **bulk import** by default. However, there is an approved plugin in the community that allows importing countries, customer groups, payment methods, tax categories, customers, and products.\n\n*   ✅ Sylius offers **multi-currency support** because you can set the base currency for each channel. However, you can't specify the price of a product per currency.\n\n*   ✅ Sylius has **payment flexibility** because you can set different payment methods for each channel. They offer a default configuration to use PayPal and Stripe as payment providers.\n\n*   ✅ In Sylius, **configurable products** can have different variations and attributes. You can edit products' general information, set their categories, and add many product attributes and images.\n\n*   ☑️ They have a grid filter to search by product name for a basic search. Sylius don't support **advanced search** by default, but you can use a plugin to extend Sylius’ basic search functionality with ElasticSearch.\n\n*   ✅ Sylius is a **headless native platform** that offers Admin and Shop APIs. A new unified Sylius API is still under development and is tagged as experimental.\n\n### Who should use Sylius\n\nSylius covers six of ten parameters, but two can be added through integrations. It fails to provide some essential features that B2B ecommerce businesses need to create different user experiences for different types of customers.\n\nOn the other hand, a B2B ecommerce business can use Sylius if it wants to provide excellent conditions to maintain extensive data and have a proven track of flexibility towards customers' needs and scale of operations.\n\n## Spree (Ruby)\n\n*   ❌ **Customer groups** are unavailable in Spree, and there isn't an official extension to add them.\n\n*   ❌ There are no **price lists**, and you can’t override product prices explicitly or bulk import prices. However, you can use promotions with rules and conditions to set custom pricing for products, users, and carts.\n\n*   ❌ In Spree, the **sales channels** feature is unavailable, and there isn't an official extension to add it.\n\n*   ✅ Spree offers **dynamic order management** by default. You can create **manual orders** from the admin panel, add products, quantities, and customer details, and choose the shipping method. You can also add order discounts and payments.\n\n*   ❌ **Bulk imports** are not supported, and there isn't an official integration to add this functionality. Some plugins can help to make bulk imports, but they seem outdated on GitHub.\n\n*   ✅ **Multi-currency support** is available out-of-the-box; each store can have multiple locales and currencies, but you can't specify the price of a product per currency. If there is more than one currency, visitors can choose which they would like to use to browse the store.\n\n*   ❌ Spree doesn't offer **payment flexibility** because you can't specify payment methods by region or country, even if you have multiple payment methods, including online and offline options.\n\n*   ✅ For **product configurations**, you can edit product details and taxonomies. You can also set product option types to manage variant types and add custom attributes and prices for each product.\n\n*   ☑️ In Spree, there isn't any **advanced search** functionality. Still, you can add an Elasticsearch integration with an extension that allows full-text searching and advanced product filtering.\n\n*   ✅ Spree is a modular **headless ecommerce** platform with two APIs. You can build an application-to-application integration and leverage its permission sets based on resource access.\n\n### Who should use Spree\n\nSpree only covers four features out-of-the-box and one more through integrations. So, using Spree can be a challenge for B2B businesses as they have to implement these features themselves for a full B2B experience.\n\nIf B2B ecommerce businesses choose Spree they’ll benefit from its versatile, modular open-source ecommerce platform that allows for easy integrations. Also, Spree's order handling system is the best fit for business models needing to do multiple actions on their customers' orders.\n\n## Prestashop (PHP)\n\n*   ✅ PrestaShop allows you to give customers certain privileges by assigning them to **customer** **groups**. By default, there are three groups available: visitor, guest, and customer. You can’t delete the default groups, but you can add new ones.\n\n*   ❌ **Price lists** aren't available by default and you can't override the price of products explicitly. It has catalog price rules to assign price reductions by category, brand, supplier, attribute, or feature, to a range of products using conditions.\n\n*   ❌ The **sales channels** feature is unavailable in Prestashop, and there isn't an official extension to add it.\n\n*   ✅ In Prestashop, **dynamic** **order management** is available by default. You can create **manual orders**, but they are called back-office orders. You can provide customer details, products, vouchers, and addresses and organize the shipping and payment. Also, you can send pre-filled orders to customers.\n\n*   ✅ **Bulk imports** are available out of the box. You can import everything into Prestashop: categories, products, customers, addresses, brands, suppliers, etc… You can also use other file formats besides CSV for the import.\n\n*   ✅ PrestaShop has **multi-currency support**, but you can't specify the price of a product per currency. You can add and configure new currencies to meet customers' needs. Currency exchange rates are calculated from one store's default currency unit.\n\n*   ✅ In Prestashop, you can set **payment methods** by currency, customer groups, or countries. Check and bank wire is the only payment methods enabled by default. However, you can install other payment modules from the Prestashop add-ons marketplace.\n\n*   ✅ You can edit product details on the **product configuration** page and add quantities, combinations, virtual products, and other stock-related options. You can set pricing options and manage your product's visibility, particular references, attached files, or suppliers.\n\n*   ☑️ Prestashop has an internal search engine from which you can configure its behavior. Also, you can install a community or paid extension from their marketplace for **advanced search** functionalities.\n\n*   ❌ Prestashop is a web application, not a **headless native platform**. You can enable the shop's web service so third-party tools can access the data.\n\n### Who should use Prestashop\n\nPrestashop covers out-of-the-box six of ten parameters, and you can add one more feature through their marketplace integration.\n\nFor B2B ecommerce businesses looking for essential features like page management and a Multi-store to sell internationally, Prestashop could be a good option; it supports over 60 languages. Prestashop's administrative panel can be adapted to the business's needs and developed in line with the growth goals.\n\nHowever, Prestashop doesn't offer price lists and sales channels nor provide a native headless architecture, which is unsuitable for B2B business models looking for extensibility and customization.\n\n## Want more?\n\nThere are plenty of good resources to discover more about B2B and open source ecommerce:\n\n*   Download our Perspective on the Open Source B2B Ecommerce industry on our [B2B-page.](https://medusajs.com/b2b-commerce-platform)\n\n*   Check out our tutorial on how you set up Medusa to support B2B: [Part 1](https://medusajs.com/blog/medusa-b2b-part-1) \u0026 [Part 2](https://medusajs.com/blog/medusa-b2b-part-2).\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/medusa-b2b-part-1.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/medusa-b2b-part-1.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/medusa-b2b-part-1.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Medusa B2B Part 1: Set Up B2B Store","date":"2022-12-12","excerpt":"This tutorial series covers how you can use Medusa and its different components and features to implement a B2B commerce store.","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/set-up-b2b-store.jpg","altText":"Medusa B2B Part 1: Set Up B2B Store","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-eb2no2kx3.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-eb2no2kx3.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-eb2no2kx3.json"},"firstName":"Shahed ","lastName":"Nasser","role":"Role","image":{"url":"/images/27354907.jpeg","altText":"Person photo"},"type":"Person"}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-a9wemp4po.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json"},"name":"Other","type":"Category"},"postSeries":"content/data/postseries-k74ho01pp.json","markdown_content":"\n\u003ccallout icon=\"exclamationCircleSolid\" button-label=\"Go to Docs\" button-url=\"http://docs.medusajs.com\"\u003e\n**Notice**\nMedusa is under active development, so the content of this post may be outdated. Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\nThis series covers how you can use Medusa's components and features to build a B2B store. The series is split in two:\n\n**Part one (this article):** Covers how to prepare your backend to handle B2B shopping experiences.\n\n[**Part two**](/blog/medusa-b2b-part-2)**:** Covers how to customize our Next.js storefront to create a B2B storefront.\n\nYou can check out the full code for this tutorial series in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/shahednasser/medusa-b2b).\n\n## Why use open source for B2B commerce?\n\nB2B commerce has seen rapid growth in recent years and is now among the top revenue-generating channels for B2B businesses according to a recent [McKinsey study](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/busting-the-five-biggest-b2b-e-commerce-myths).\n\nYet, many businesses struggle to get their B2B setup right. Mostly, challenges come from a need to build more custom logic and integration to handle the higher complexity of B2B sales.\n\nSome examples of B2B complexities:\n\n*   Unique customers: Special purchasing agreements require the possibility to create custom logic for individual B2B customer groups\n*   Special pricing: The commerce engine needs to be able to differentiate pricing and discounts based on customer groups\n*   Omnichannel need: Selling to B2B is often not a one-channel-effort and the commerce engine needs to be able to handle multiple channels\n\n### **Why use Medusa**\n\n[Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) is an open source composable commerce engine. Unlike existing proprietary platforms, its value proposition comes from the flexible and open architecture that equips tech teams with a unique possibility to build bespoke commerce setups. This is even more important in the context of complex B2B businesses\n\nMedusa provides the foundational commerce infrastructure for businesses to take full ownership of their tech stack and avoid compromising on business needs. Custom logic can be injected natively instead of through hacky workarounds.\n\nOur developer-first approach is a central element in this promise of customization and composability. That is why we want to give developers the essential features we find necessary for building a B2B commerce setup.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll take you through how you combine these to achieve a scaleable B2B setup.\n\n## Medusa’s Recipe for a B2B Commerce Store\n\nMedusa provides many essential commerce [features](http://localhost:3000/introduction#features). For the B2B case, in particular, you’ll be using the following features in Medusa to create a B2B commerce store:\n\n*   [Sales Channels](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/sales-channels/): Sales Channels allow you to segment your product catalog across the channels you sell through. For B2B commerce stores, Sales Channels can be used to specify which products are available for B2B customers.\n*   [Customer Groups](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/customer-groups/): Customer Groups allow you to combine customers with similar attributes. For B2B commerce stores, they can be used to combine customers that belong to an organization that purchases products from your store.\n*   [Price Lists](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/price-lists/): Price Lists can be used to override products’ prices based on different conditions. For B2B commerce stores, they can be used to set the prices negotiated with B2B customers.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n### Node.js\n\nMedusa is a Node.js commerce platform. So, you must have at least version 14 of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.\n\n### PostgreSQL\n\nAlthough Medusa works with an SQLite database, it is highly recommended to use PostgreSQL instead. You can follow [our documentation to learn how to install it](https://docs.medusajs.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment#postgresql).\n\nMake sure to also create an empty PostgreSQL database.\n\n### Medusa CLI Tool\n\nYou’ll need Medusa’s CLI tool to install a Medusa server. You can install the CLI tool with the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install @medusajs/medusa-cli -g\n```\n\n\u003e If you face any error with this installation, please check out the [troubleshooting guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/troubleshooting/cli-installation-errors).\n\n## Install the Medusa Server\n\nIn your terminal, run the following command to install the Medusa server:\n\n```\nmedusa new b2b-server\n```\n\nThis will install a Medusa server under a newly created `b2b-server` directory. Once the command is done executing, change to that directory:\n\n```\ncd b2b-server\n```\n\n## Configure Medusa Server\n\n### Enable Sales Channels\n\nSales Channels is a feature in Medusa that allows you to separate between the different sales channels you sell your products in, and ensure different products are available for each sales channel. For example, you can have a Sales Channel for mobile stores, another for website storefronts, and so on.\n\nIn the case of B2B stores, you can create a B2B Sales Channel that groups all wholesale products that should only be available to B2B customers.\n\nSales Channels is currently in beta mode, so you have to enable it manually to use it.\n\nIn the `.env` file of your Medusa server, add the following environment variable:\n\n```\nMEDUSA_FF_SALES_CHANNELS=true\n```\n\nThis will enable sales channels on your Medusa server.\n\n### Add Database Configuration\n\nBy default, Medusa runs with an SQLite database. This is great for development purposes, but for an optimal experience, it’s recommended to use a PostgreSQL database instead.\n\nIn `.env`, add the following environment variable:\n\n```\nDATABASE_URL=\u003cDATABASE_URL\u003e\n```\n\nWhere `\u003cDATABASE_URL\u003e` is the URL of your database. If you’re unsure of what your URL is, check out [PostgreSQL’s documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING) to see its format.\n\nThen, in `medusa-config.js`, you’ll find an exported object similar to this:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  projectConfig: {\n    // redis_url: REDIS_URL,\n    // For more production-like environment install PostgresQL\n    // database_url: DATABASE_URL,\n    // database_type: \"postgres\",\n    database_database: \"./medusa-db.sql\",\n    database_type: \"sqlite\",\n    store_cors: STORE_CORS,\n    admin_cors: ADMIN_CORS,\n  },\n  plugins,\n};\n```\n\nRemove the SQLite database configuration and un-comment the PostgreSQL configurations as such:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  projectConfig: {\n    // redis_url: REDIS_URL,\n    database_url: DATABASE_URL,\n    database_type: \"postgres\",\n    store_cors: STORE_CORS,\n    admin_cors: ADMIN_CORS,\n  },\n  plugins,\n};\n```\n\n### Run Migrations\n\nThe Medusa server has migrations defined for all its entities so that you can smoothly prepare your database schema for your commerce store.\n\nRun the following command in the root directory of your Medusa server to migrate entities into your database schema:\n\n```\nmedusa migrations run\n```\n\n### Seed Database\n\nThis step is optional but recommended for the sake of the tutorial. You can seed your database with demo data such as an admin user and products.\n\nRun the following command in the root directory of the Medusa server to seed your database:\n\n```\nnpm run seed\n```\n\n### Install a File Service Plugin\n\nFile service plugins in Medusa are used to store files such as product images. Although this step is optional for this tutorial, if you want to add products with images in your store, you must install a file service plugin.\n\nMedusa provides three official file service plugins: [MinIO](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/minio), [Spaces](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/spaces), and [S3](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/s3). You can follow along with the documentation of the file service plugin of your choice to learn how to install it.\n\n## Test Medusa Server\n\nIn the root directory of your Medusa server, run the following command to run your Medusa server:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis runs your Medusa server on port `9000`. You can test it out by opening `localhost:9000/store/products` in your browser. If you seeded the database earlier, you should see many products in the response. Otherwise, you can see an empty array of products in the response.\n\nIt’s recommended to keep the Medusa server running throughout the tutorial as you’ll need it for all the steps.\n\n## Install Medusa Admin\n\nMedusa provides an admin panel that allows you to manage the different settings and data of your Medusa server, including products, sales channels, customers, and much more.\n\nIn a different directory than the Medusa server, run the following command to clone the Admin panel from GitHub:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/medusajs/admin b2b-admin\n```\n\nThis creates a new directory `b2b-admin` and clones the codebase of the Medusa admin into it.\n\nChange into the new directory and install the dependencies with NPM:\n\n```\ncd b2b-admin \u0026\u0026 npm install\n```\n\n### Test Medusa Admin\n\nOnce the NPM installation is done, make sure that the Medusa server is running, then run the following command in the `b2b-admin` directory:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis runs the Medusa admin on `localhost:7000` by default. If you open it in your browser, you should see a login screen.\n\n![](/images/XYqMCo9-0a980165.png)\n\nIf you seeded the database earlier, you can log in with the email `admin@medusa-test.com` and password `supersecret`. If not, you can [create a user using the Medusa CLI tool](https://docs.medusajs.com/cli/reference#user).\n\n## Add Wholesale Products\n\nAfter you log in to the admin, go to the Products page from the sidebar. If you’ve seeded the database you should find some products already added.\n\nTo add new products:\n\n1.  Go to the Products page.\n2.  Click on the New Product button at the top right.\n3.  Enter details related to general information, variants, prices, and more.\n4.  Once you’re done, click on the Publish Products button.\n\nYou can add as many products as you want.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-10-06\\_at\\_3.42.34\\_PM.png)\n\n## Create B2B Sales Channel\n\nAs mentioned earlier, you’ll create a B2B Sales Channel to add Wholesale Products. These products will then only be available in that sales channel.\n\nTo create a B2B Sales Channel:\n\n1.  Go to Settings → Sales Channels\n2.  In the Sales Channels section on the left, click on the plus icon next to the title of the section.\n3.  The form to create a new sales channel will open. Enter a name and description for the sales channel. You can set the name to “B2B”\n4.  Once you’re done, click on the Publish Channel button.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-10-06\\_at\\_2.30.54\\_PM.png)\n\n### Add Products to the Sales Channel\n\nNow, you can add products to your B2B sales channel. To do that:\n\n1.  Go to Settings → Sales Channels\n2.  In the sales channels list on the left, choose the B2B sales channel.\n3.  At the top right of the right section, click on the three dots icon.\n4.  Choose from the dropdown list “Add products”.\n5.  Select the products you want to add to the sales channel.\n6.  Once you’re done, click on the Save button.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-10-06\\_at\\_2.34.11\\_PM.png)\n\n## Create B2B Customer Groups\n\nCustomer groups allow you to group together customers that have common criteria. You can then use this group to apply special pricing for these customers.\n\nIn the B2B case in this tutorial, you’ll create a customer group for every organization that will be a B2B customer.\n\nTo differentiate every B2B customer group from other customer groups, you’ll also add in the `metadata` field of the customer group an `is_b2b` flag.\n\nTo create a B2B customer group in the admin:\n\n1.  Go to the Customers page.\n2.  Choose the Groups headline.\n3.  Click on the New Group button.\n4.  In the new window that opens:\n    1.  Enter the name of the organization in the Title field.\n    2.  Click on the Add Metadata button. This shows additional Key and Value fields.\n    3.  Enter in the Key field `is_b2b` and in the Value field `true`.\n5.  Once you’re done, click on the Publish Group button.\n\nDo these steps for every organization you want to add.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-10-06\\_at\\_5.08.02\\_PM.png)\n\n### Create Customers\n\nBefore you can add customers to the customer group, you need to create the customers. You’ll need to use the API Endpoints to do that. You can use a tool like Postman to send requests, or you can use cURL.\n\nStart by logging in using the [User Login](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin/#tag/Auth/operation/PostAuth) endpoint. Send a `POST` request to `localhost:9000/admin/auth` with the following request body:\n\n```\n {\n    \"email\": \"admin@medusa-test.com\",\n    \"password\": \"supersecret\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can replace the email and password with your own if you’re using different ones.\n\nWhen you log, the Session ID is set in the cookies. In tools like Postman, you can go ahead and send the rest of the requests and it appends that Session ID to the cookies of those requests. If you’re using cURL, you can learn how to set the Cookie Session ID in [our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin/#section/Authentication/cookie_auth).\n\nNext, you’ll create a customer using the [Create a Customer](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin/#tag/Customer/operation/PostCustomers) endpoint. Send a `POST` request to `localhost:9000/admin/customers` with the following request body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"email\": \"customer@acme.com\",\n    \"first_name\": \"Acme\",\n    \"last_name\": \"Customer\",\n    \"password\": \"supersecret\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can change the values of any of the fields as necessary.\n\nYou can add as many customers as you want. Once you’re done, if you go back to the Medusa admin, you can see the new customer on the Customers page.\n\n### Add Customers to Customer Group\n\nIn this section, you’ll add the customers you created to the customer group of their organization.\n\nTo add customers to a customer group:\n\n1.  Go to each of the B2B customer group’s details page.\n2.  Click on the “Edit customers” button at the top right of the Customers section.\n3.  Check the box next to every customer you want to add to the group.\n4.  Click on the Save button.\n\n## Create B2B Price List\n\nPrice lists in Medusa are a list of prices that are applied on specific products under defined conditions. For example, you can set different prices for different customer groups. You can also specify prices based on the quantity of the product in the cart.\n\nIn this section, you’ll create a B2B Price List that applies to all the B2B customer groups you created in the previous sections. You’ll then set different prices for each of the wholesale products.\n\nTo create a price list:\n\n1.  Go to the Pricing page.\n2.  Click on the “Add price list” button at the top right.\n3.  In the new form that opens:\n    1.  Choose Override under the Price list type.\n    2.  Expand the General collapsible section. Enter a name for the price list (for example, B2B) and a description.\n    3.  Expand the Configuration collapsible section. Then, toggle the Customer availability field and choose all the B2B customer groups you created.\n    4.  You can add prices manually at this point, you can add them manually after creating the price list, or you can import prices from a CSV file after creation. To add prices manually now:\n        1.  Expand the Prices collapsible section.\n        2.  Click on the Add Products Manually button.\n        3.  Check all the products you want to add then click the Save button.\n        4.  For all of the products you added, click on the + icon. This will expand the list of variants for that product. You can specify the same prices for all variants, remove some of the variants from the price list, and specify different prices for all variants. To specify prices:\n            1.  Click on the three dots icon next to each of the variants and choose Edit prices.\n            2.  In the new window, either select Apply overrides on selected variants or Apply on all variants and add the price for every currency in your store.\n            3.  Once you’re done, click Save and Close.\n    5.  Once you’re done, click on the Publish price list button at the top right.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-10-06\\_at\\_2.47.12\\_PM.png)\n\n### Importing Prices\n\nAs mentioned earlier, you can import prices from a CSV file. This will replace any prices you’ve added before.\n\nTo import prices from a CSV file:\n\n1.  Go to the B2B price list’s details page.\n2.  In the Prices section, click on the three dots icon and click on “Import price list” from the dropdown.\n3.  In the new window:\n    1.  If you’re unsure of what the CSV file’s format must be like, you can download a template CSV file by clicking the download icon.\n    2.  To upload the CSV file you want to import prices from, either:\n        1.  Drag and drop the file into the dashed box;\n        2.  Or click on the dashed box and choose the file you want to import the prices from.\n    3.  After you upload the CSV file, you can check the number of prices to be added above the uploaded file’s name.\n4.  Once you’re done choosing a file to import prices from, click on the Import List button.\n\n### Adding Prices Using the APIs\n\nYou can also add prices using the API endpoints. These provide you with even more options than what is currently available in the admin, such as prices based on quantity in the cart.\n\nTo add prices to a price list, send a `POST` request to `{{BACKEND_URL}}/admin/price-lists/{price_list_id}/prices/batch` (replacing `{price_list_id}` with the ID of the price list) with the following request body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"prices\": [\n        {\n            \"amount\": 100,\n            \"variant_id\": \"{variant_id_1}\",\n            \"currency_code\": \"eur\",\n            \"min_quantity\": 10\n        },\n        {\n            \"amount\": 200,\n            \"variant_id\": \"{variant_id_2}\",\n            \"currency_code\": \"eur\",\n            \"max_quantity\": 9\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nEach object in the `prices` array is an object that contains the amount, the ID of the variant to apply the price to, the currency code, and other conditions such as `min_quantity` and `max_quantity`. You can check all the conditions you can pass by referring to the [API Reference](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin/#tag/Price-List/operation/PostPriceListsPriceListPricesBatch).\n\n## Add Endpoint to Check Customer Group\n\nThe last step is to create an endpoint on the Medusa server to allow you to check whether a customer belongs to a B2B customer group or not. This is helpful when you start customizing the storefront, as you need to figure out what type of customer is logged in.\n\nTo create an endpoint, create the file `b2b-server/src/api/index.ts` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { CustomerService } from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\nimport { Router } from \"express\"\nimport authenticate from \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/api/middlewares/authenticate-customer\"\nimport cors from \"cors\"\nimport { projectConfig } from \"../../medusa-config\"\n\nexport default () =\u003e {\n  const router = Router()\n\n  const corsOptions = {\n    origin: projectConfig.store_cors.split(\",\"),\n    credentials: true,\n  }\n\n  router.options(\"/store/customers/is-b2b\", cors(corsOptions))\n  router.get(\"/store/customers/is-b2b\", cors(corsOptions), authenticate(), async (req, res) =\u003e {\n    if (!req.user) {\n      return res.json({\n        is_b2b: false\n      })\n    }\n\n    const customerService: CustomerService = req.scope.resolve('customerService');\n\n    const customer = await customerService\n      .retrieve(req.user.customer_id, {\n        relations: ['groups']\n      })\n\n    const is_b2b = customer.groups.some((group) =\u003e group.metadata.is_b2b === \"true\");\n    \n    return res.json({\n      is_b2b\n    })\n  })\n\n  return router;\n}\n```\n\nIn this file, you add a new storefront endpoint `/store/customers/is-b2b`. This endpoint checks if the currently logged-in customer belongs to a B2B customer group.\n\nLooking back at when you created each customer group, you set in its `metadata` field `is_b2b` to `true`. In this endpoint, you retrieve the customer along with their customer groups, then check if any of its customer groups has the `is_b2b` field set to `true`.\n\n### Test Endpoint\n\nTo test the endpoint, first, run the following command to transpile the TypeScript file into the `dist` directory:\n\n```\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThen, start the Medusa server:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nUsing a tool like Postman, try to first login with a B2B customer then send a request to `localhost:9000/store/customers/is-b2b`. You should see that it returns `is_b2b` with the value `true`.\n\nIf you try sending that same request when the customer is logged-out, or when the customer does not belong to a B2B customer group, `is_b2b` in the response should be set to `false`.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nThis concludes preparing your Medusa backend to be used for a B2B shopping experience. In the next part of the tutorial, you’ll learn how you can customize the Next.js storefront to implement the entire B2B flow for the customers.\n\nYou can also check out the following resources in our documentation to learn more about the different components used in this tutorial:\n\n*   [Sales Channels](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/sales-channels/) and [how to use them](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/sales-channels/manage-admin).\n*   [Customer Groups](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/customer-groups/) and [how to use them](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/admin/use-customergroups-api).\n*   [Price Lists](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/price-lists/) and [how to use them](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/price-lists/use-api).\n\n\u003e Should you have any issues or questions related to Medusa, then feel free to reach out to the Medusa team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp).\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/medusa-b2b-part-2.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/medusa-b2b-part-2.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/medusa-b2b-part-2.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Medusa B2B Part 2: Set Up B2B Storefront","date":"2022-12-12","excerpt":"Part 2 of this series explores how to customize the Next.js storefront to add a Wholesaler login form and display B2B products.","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/set-up-b2b-storefront.jpg","altText":"Medusa B2B Part 2: Set Up B2B Storefront","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-eb2no2kx3.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-eb2no2kx3.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-eb2no2kx3.json"},"firstName":"Shahed ","lastName":"Nasser","role":"Role","image":{"url":"/images/27354907.jpeg","altText":"Person photo"},"type":"Person"}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-a9wemp4po.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json"},"name":"Other","type":"Category"},"postSeries":"content/data/postseries-k74ho01pp.json","markdown_content":"\n\u003ccallout icon=\"exclamationCircleSolid\" button-label=\"Go to Docs\" button-url=\"http://docs.medusajs.com\"\u003e\n**Notice**\nMedusa is under active development, so the content of this post may be outdated. Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\nIn part 1 of the B2B series, you learned how to set up your [Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) server for a B2B ecommerce use case. You set up a B2B Sales Channel, Customer Groups, and Price List. You also added an endpoint that checks whether a customer is a B2B customer or not.\n\nIn this part of the series, you’ll customize Medusa’s [Next.js storefront](https://docs.medusajs.com/starters/nextjs-medusa-starter) to add a Wholesaler login screen and a different way of displaying products for B2B customers. You’ll also explore how the checkout flow works for B2B customers.\n\nYou can find the full code for this tutorial series in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/shahednasser/medusa-b2b).\n\n![](/images/Screen_Recording\\_2022-10-19\\_at\\_11.16.22\\_AM.gif)\n\n\n\n## Install Next.js Storefront\n\nIn your terminal, run the following command to install the Next.js Storefront:\n\n```\nnpx create-next-app -e https://github.com/medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa b2b-storefront\n```\n\nThis installs the Next.js storefront in a newly created directory `b2b-storefront`.\n\nThen, change to the `b2b-storefront` directory and rename the `.env.template` file:\n\n```\ncd b2b-storefront\nmv .env.template .env.local\n```\n\n### Install Dependencies\n\nTo ensure you’re using the latest version of Medusa dependencies, run the following command to update Medusa dependencies:\n\n```\nnpm install @medusajs/medusa@latest @medusajs/medusa-js@latest medusa-react@latest\n```\n\nIn addition, install `axios` to send requests to the custom endpoint you created in the previous tutorial:\n\n```\nnpm install axios\n```\n\n### Add Sales Channel Environment Variable\n\nYou’ll be using the Sales Channel you created in the first part to retrieve B2B products for B2B customers and to set the correct Sales Channel for B2B customers’ carts.\n\nSo, you need to set the ID of the sales channel in an environment variable.\n\nIf you’re unsure what the ID of the sales channel is, you can send a request to the [List Sales Channel](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin/#tag/Sales-Channel/operation/GetSalesChannels) admin endpoint. You should find a Sales Channel with the name “B2B”. Copy the ID of that Sales Channel.\n\nThen, add the following environment variable in `.env.local`:\n\n```\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SALES_CHANNEL_ID=\u003cYOUR_SALES_CHANNEL_ID\u003e\n```\n\nWhere `\u003cYOUR_SALES_CHANNEL_ID\u003e` is the ID of the B2B Sales Channel.\n\n## Create a Wholesale Login Page\n\nIn this section, you’ll add a login page specific to B2B customers. This requires adding some new pages and files, but also customizing existing logic.\n\n### Change AccountContext\n\nThe Next.js storefront defines an `AccountContext` that allows you to get access to customer-related data and functionalities across your storefront. You need to make changes to it to add a new variable to the context: `is_b2b`. This variable will allow you to check whether the customer is a B2B customer or not throughout the storefront.\n\nIn `src/lib/context/account-context.tsx`, add the `is_b2b` attribute to the `AccountContext` interface:\n\n```\ninterface AccountContext {\n  //...\n  is_b2b: boolean\n}\n```\n\nThen, at the beginning of the `AccountProvider` function, add a new state variable `is_b2b`:\n\n```\nexport const AccountProvider = ({ children }: AccountProviderProps) =\u003e {\n  const [is_b2b, setIsB2b] = useState(false)\n\t//...\n}\n```\n\nNext, add a new callback function `checkB2b` inside the `AccountProvider` function:\n\n```\nimport axios from \"axios\"\nimport { useRouter } from \"next/router\"\nimport { MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, medusaClient } from \"@lib/config\"\n//...\n\nexport const AccountProvider = ({ children }: AccountProviderProps) =\u003e {\n\t//...\n\tconst checkB2b = useCallback(async () =\u003e {\n    if (customer) {\n      //check if the customer is a b2b customer\n      const { data } = await axios.get(`${MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL}/store/customers/is-b2b`, {\n        withCredentials: true\n      })\n      setIsB2b(data.is_b2b)\n    } else {\n      setIsB2b(false)\n    }\n  }, [customer])\n\n\tuseEffect(() =\u003e {\n    checkB2b()\n  }, [checkB2b])\n\t//...\n}\n```\n\nThis function sends a request to the `/store/customers/is-b2b` endpoint that you created in part 1. It then changes the value of the `is_b2b` state variable based on the response received.\n\nYou also run this callback function in `useEffect` which triggers the function whenever there’s a change in the callback. In other words, whenever the `customer` is changed.\n\nYou also need to set the value of `is_b2b` back to `false` when the customer logs out. You can add that in the `handleLogout` function in `AccountProvider`:\n\n```\nconst handleLogout = () =\u003e {\n    useDeleteSession.mutate(undefined, {\n      onSuccess: () =\u003e {\n        //...\n        setIsB2b(false)\n      },\n    })\n  }\n```\n\nLastly, pass `is_b2b` in the `value` prop of `AccountContext.Provider`:\n\n```\nreturn (\n    \u003cAccountContext.Provider\n      value={{\n        //...\n        is_b2b\n      }}\n    \u003e\n      {children}\n    \u003c/AccountContext.Provider\u003e\n  )\n```\n\nThese are all the changes necessary to enable checking whether the customer is a B2B customer or not throughout the storefront.\n\nThere’s also one last change to make that enhances the customer experience. Change the `checkSession` function in `AccountProvider` to the following:\n\n```\nconst checkSession = useCallback(() =\u003e {\n  if (!customer \u0026\u0026 !retrievingCustomer) {\n    router.push(router.pathname.includes(\"wholesale\") ? \"/wholesale/account/login\" : \"/account/login\")\n  }\n}, [customer, retrievingCustomer, router])\n```\n\nPreviously, the function redirects the customer to `/account/login` if they were trying to access account pages. To ensure that a guest customer gets redirected to the wholesaler login page when they try to access a wholesale page, you add a condition that determines where the guest customer should be redirected.\n\n### Change StoreContext\n\nThe Next.js storefront also defines a `StoreContext` that manages the store’s regions, cart, and more.\n\nIn this section, you’ll make changes to the `StoreContext` to ensure the correct sales channel is assigned to B2B customers’ carts.\n\nIn `src/lib/context/store-context.tsx`, change the `createNewCart` function in the `StoreProvider` function to the following:\n\n```\nimport { MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, medusaClient } from \"@lib/config\"\nimport axios from \"axios\"\nimport React, { createContext, useCallback, useContext, useEffect, useState } from \"react\"\n//...\n\nexport const StoreProvider = ({ children }: StoreProps) =\u003e {\n\t//...\n\tconst createNewCart = async (regionId?: string) =\u003e {\n    const cartData: {\n      region_id?: string,\n      sales_channel_id?: string\n    } = { region_id: regionId }\n\n    if (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SALES_CHANNEL_ID) {\n      //check if customer is b2b\n      const { data } = await axios.get(`${MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL}/store/customers/is-b2b`, {\n        withCredentials: true\n      })\n\n      if (data.is_b2b) {\n        cartData.sales_channel_id = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SALES_CHANNEL_ID\n      }\n    }\n\n    await createCart.mutateAsync(\n      cartData,\n      {\n        onSuccess: ({ cart }) =\u003e {\n          setCart(cart)\n          storeCart(cart.id)\n          ensureRegion(cart.region)\n        },\n        onError: (error) =\u003e {\n          if (process.env.NODE_ENV === \"development\") {\n            console.error(error)\n          }\n        },\n      }\n    )\n  }\n\t//...\n}\n```\n\nPreviously, this function only passed the region ID to the `createCart` mutation. By making the above change you check first if the customer is a B2B customer and add the `sales_channel_id` field to the data to be passed to the `createCart` mutation.\n\nNext, change the `resetCart` function in the `StoreProvider` function to the following:\n\n```\nexport const StoreProvider = ({ children }: StoreProps) =\u003e {\n\t//...\n\tconst resetCart = async () =\u003e {\n    deleteCart()\n\n    const savedRegion = getRegion()\n\n    const cartData: {\n      region_id?: string,\n      sales_channel_id?: string\n    } = { region_id: savedRegion?.regionId }\n\n    if (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SALES_CHANNEL_ID) {\n      //check if customer is b2b\n      const { data } = await axios.get(`${MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL}/store/customers/is-b2b`, {\n        withCredentials: true\n      })\n\n      if (data.is_b2b) {\n        cartData.sales_channel_id = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SALES_CHANNEL_ID\n      }\n    }\n\n    createCart.mutate(\n      cartData,\n      {\n        onSuccess: ({ cart }) =\u003e {\n          setCart(cart)\n          storeCart(cart.id)\n          ensureRegion(cart.region)\n        },\n        onError: (error) =\u003e {\n          if (process.env.NODE_ENV === \"development\") {\n            console.error(error)\n          }\n        },\n      }\n    )\n  }\n\t//...\n}\n```\n\nThis change is similar to the previous change. It ensures that the correct sales channel ID is assigned to the cart when it’s reset.\n\nFinally, change the `ensureCart` function inside `useEffect` to the following:\n\n```\nuseEffect(() =\u003e {\n    const ensureCart = async () =\u003e {\n      const cartId = getCart()\n      const region = getRegion()\n\n      if (cartId) {\n        const cartRes = await medusaClient.carts\n          .retrieve(cartId)\n          .then(async ({ cart }) =\u003e {\n            if (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SALES_CHANNEL_ID \u0026\u0026 cart.sales_channel_id !== process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SALES_CHANNEL_ID) {\n              //check if b2b customer\n              const { data } = await axios.get(`${MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL}/store/customers/is-b2b`, {\n                withCredentials: true\n              })\n              if (data.is_b2b) {\n                //update cart's sales channel\n                const response = await medusaClient.carts.update(cart.id, {\n                  sales_channel_id: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SALES_CHANNEL_ID\n                })\n\n                return response.cart\n              }\n            }\n            return cart\n          })\n          .catch(async (_) =\u003e {\n            return null\n          })\n\n        if (!cartRes || cartRes.completed_at) {\n          deleteCart()\n          await createNewCart(region?.regionId)\n          return\n        }\n\n        setCart(cartRes)\n        ensureRegion(cartRes.region)\n      } else {\n        await createNewCart(region?.regionId)\n      }\n    }\n\n    if (!IS_SERVER \u0026\u0026 !cart?.id) {\n      ensureCart()\n    }\n    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\n  }, [])\n```\n\nSimilar to the previous changes, this ensures that when the storefront is opened and the cart is retrieved, the correct sales channel is assigned to the cart.\n\n### Change the Nav Component\n\nTo ensure customers can access the wholesale login page, you’ll add a new link to the navigation bar.\n\nIn `src/modules/layout/templates/nav/index.tsx` add the following in the returned JSX above the Account link:\n\n```\n\u003cLink href=\"/wholesale/account\"\u003e\n    \u003ca\u003eWholesale Account\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/Link\u003e\n\u003cLink href=\"/account\"\u003e\n  \u003ca\u003eAccount\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/Link\u003e\n```\n\n### Add Login Form Component\n\nThe login page should display a login form for the customer.\n\nTo create the login form, create the file `src/modules/wholesale/components/login/index.tsx` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { FieldValues, useForm } from \"react-hook-form\"\nimport { MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, medusaClient } from \"@lib/config\"\n\nimport Button from \"@modules/common/components/button\"\nimport Input from \"@modules/common/components/input\"\nimport axios from \"axios\"\nimport { useAccount } from \"@lib/context/account-context\"\nimport { useCart } from \"medusa-react\"\nimport { useRouter } from \"next/router\"\nimport { useState } from \"react\"\n\ninterface SignInCredentials extends FieldValues {\n  email: string\n  password: string\n}\n\nconst Login = () =\u003e {\n  const { refetchCustomer, is_b2b } = useAccount()\n  const [authError, setAuthError] = useState\u003cstring | undefined\u003e(undefined)\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const { cart, updateCart } = useCart()\n\n  const handleError = (_e: Error) =\u003e {\n    setAuthError(\"Invalid email or password\")\n  }\n\n  const {\n    register,\n    handleSubmit,\n    formState: { errors },\n  } = useForm\u003cSignInCredentials\u003e()\n\n  const onSubmit = handleSubmit(async (credentials) =\u003e {\n    medusaClient.auth\n      .authenticate(credentials)\n      .then(async () =\u003e {\n        refetchCustomer()\n        if (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SALES_CHANNEL_ID \u0026\u0026 cart?.sales_channel_id !== process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SALES_CHANNEL_ID) {\n          const { data } = await axios.get(`${MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL}/store/customers/is-b2b`, {\n            withCredentials: true\n          })\n          if (data.is_b2b) {\n            updateCart.mutate({\n              sales_channel_id: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SALES_CHANNEL_ID\n            })\n          }\n        }\n        router.push(is_b2b ? \"/wholesale/account\" : \"/account\")\n      })\n      .catch(handleError)\n  })\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv className=\"max-w-sm w-full flex flex-col items-center\"\u003e\n      \u003ch1 className=\"text-large-semi uppercase mb-6\"\u003eWelcome back\u003c/h1\u003e\n      \u003cp className=\"text-center text-base-regular text-gray-700 mb-8\"\u003e\n        Sign in to your wholesale account\n      \u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cform className=\"w-full\" onSubmit={onSubmit}\u003e\n        \u003cdiv className=\"flex flex-col w-full gap-y-2\"\u003e\n          \u003cInput\n            label=\"Email\"\n            {...register(\"email\", { required: \"Email is required\" })}\n            autoComplete=\"email\"\n            errors={errors}\n          /\u003e\n          \u003cInput\n            label=\"Password\"\n            {...register(\"password\", { required: \"Password is required\" })}\n            type=\"password\"\n            autoComplete=\"current-password\"\n            errors={errors}\n          /\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n        {authError \u0026\u0026 (\n          \u003cdiv\u003e\n            \u003cspan className=\"text-rose-500 w-full text-small-regular\"\u003e\n              These credentials do not match our records\n            \u003c/span\u003e\n          \u003c/div\u003e\n        )}\n        \u003cButton className=\"mt-6\"\u003eEnter\u003c/Button\u003e\n      \u003c/form\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Login\n```\n\nThis login form shows the customer the fields `email` and `password`. When the customer submits the form and they’re authenticated successfully, you check if the customer is a B2B customer and accordingly update the cart’s sales channel ID.\n\nThis is important as products can only be added to a cart that belongs to the same sales channel.\n\n### Add Login Template Component\n\nThe login template component will be displayed on the Login page.\n\nCreate the file `src/modules/wholesale/templates/login-template.tsx` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport Login from \"../components/login\"\nimport { useAccount } from \"@lib/context/account-context\"\nimport { useEffect } from \"react\"\nimport { useRouter } from \"next/router\"\n\nconst WholesaleLoginTemplate = () =\u003e {\n  const { customer, retrievingCustomer, is_b2b } = useAccount()\n\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    if (!retrievingCustomer \u0026\u0026 customer ) {\n      router.push(is_b2b ? \"/wholesale/account\" : \"/account\")\n    }\n  }, [customer, retrievingCustomer, router, is_b2b])\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv className=\"w-full flex justify-center py-24\"\u003e\n      \u003cLogin /\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport default WholesaleLoginTemplate\n```\n\nIn this template, you first check if the customer is already logged in and redirect them to their account page based on whether they’re a B2B customer or not.\n\nIf the customer is not logged in, you show the `Login` form component.\n\n### Add Login Page\n\nCreate the file `src/pages/wholesale/account/login.tsx` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport Head from \"@modules/common/components/head\"\nimport Layout from \"@modules/layout/templates\"\nimport LoginTemplate from \"@modules/wholesale/templates/login-template\"\nimport { NextPageWithLayout } from \"types/global\"\n\nconst Login: NextPageWithLayout = () =\u003e {\n  return (\n    \u003c\u003e\n      \u003cHead title=\"Sign in\" description=\"Sign in to your Wholesale account.\" /\u003e\n      \u003cLoginTemplate /\u003e\n    \u003c/\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nLogin.getLayout = (page) =\u003e {\n  return \u003cLayout\u003e{page}\u003c/Layout\u003e\n}\n\nexport default Login\n```\n\nThis is the login page that the customer sees when they access the `/wholesale/account/login` path. It shows the `LoginTemplate` component.\n\n### Add Wholesale Account Page\n\nThe last part you’ll add to finish the Wholesale login functionality is the account page for wholesalers. This page is shown when the B2B customer is logged in.\n\nCreate the file `src/pages/wholesale/account/index.tsx` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport AccountLayout from \"@modules/account/templates/account-layout\"\nimport Head from \"@modules/common/components/head\"\nimport Layout from \"@modules/layout/templates\"\nimport { NextPageWithLayout } from \"types/global\"\nimport OverviewTemplate from \"@modules/account/templates/overview-template\"\nimport { ReactElement } from \"react\"\nimport { useAccount } from \"@lib/context/account-context\"\nimport { useRouter } from \"next/router\"\n\nconst Account: NextPageWithLayout = () =\u003e {\n  const { customer, is_b2b } = useAccount()\n  const router = useRouter()\n\n  if (customer \u0026\u0026 !is_b2b) {\n    router.push(\"/account\")\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003c\u003e\n      \u003cHead title=\"Wholesale Account\" description=\"Overview of your account activity.\" /\u003e\n      \u003cOverviewTemplate /\u003e\n    \u003c/\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nAccount.getLayout = (page: ReactElement) =\u003e {\n  return (\n    \u003cLayout\u003e\n      \u003cAccountLayout\u003e{page}\u003c/AccountLayout\u003e\n    \u003c/Layout\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Account\n```\n\nIn this page, you first check whether the customer is logged in but they’re not a B2B customer. In that case, you redirect them to the `/account` page which is used by other types of customers.\n\nOn this page, you show the same `OverviewTemplate` that is shown by default for customers. This is for the simplicity of the tutorial. If you want to display other information to B2B customers, you can make the changes on this page.\n\n### Test Wholesale Login\n\nMake sure the Medusa server you created in part 1 is running. Then, run the following command to run the Next.js storefront:\n\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nOpen the storefront at `localhost:8000` and click on the Wholesale Account link in the navigation bar. This will open the login page you created.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-10-19\\_at\\_12.13.02\\_PM.png)\n\n\n\nIn part 1 you created a customer in a B2B customer group. Use the email and password of that customer to log in.\n\nOnce you’re logged in, you’ll be redirected to the `/wholesale/account` page.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-10-19\\_at\\_12.36.00\\_PM.png)\n\n\n\n## Create B2B Products Page\n\nIn this section, you’ll customize the current product page (available on the page `/store`) to show products as a list of variants in a table. This makes it easier for B2B customers to view available products and their variants and add big quantities of them to the cart.\n\n### Change ProductContext\n\nAnother context that the Next.js storefront defines is the `ProductContext` which manages a product’s options, price, variants, and more.\n\nYou’ll be customizing this context to expose in the context the `setQuantity` function that allows setting the quantity to be added to the cart.\n\nIn `src/lib/context/product-context.tsx`, add in the `ProductContext` interface the `setQuantity` function:\n\n```\ninterface ProductContext {\n  //...\n  setQuantity: (quantity: number) =\u003e void\n}\n```\n\nThen, add the function to the object passed to the `ProductActionContext.Provider`'s `value` prop:\n\n```\nreturn (\n    \u003cProductActionContext.Provider\n      value={{\n        //...\n        setQuantity\n      }}\n    \u003e\n      {children}\n    \u003c/ProductActionContext.Provider\u003e\n  )\n```\n\nPlease note that the function is already defined in the context with the `quantity` state variable.\n\n### Create ProductActions Component\n\nThe `ProductActions` component is a component that displays a button and a quantity input and handles the add-to-cart functionality. It’ll be displayed for each variant in the products table.\n\nCreate the file `src/modules/wholesale/components/product-actions/index.tsx` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { Product, Variant } from \"types/medusa\"\nimport React, { useEffect, useMemo, useState } from \"react\"\n\nimport Button from \"@modules/common/components/button\"\nimport { isEqual } from \"lodash\"\nimport { useProductActions } from \"@lib/context/product-context\"\n\ntype ProductActionsProps = {\n  product: Product\n  selectedVariant: Variant\n}\n\nconst ProductActions: React.FC\u003cProductActionsProps\u003e = ({ product, selectedVariant }) =\u003e {\n  const { updateOptions, addToCart, inStock, options, quantity, setQuantity } =\n    useProductActions()\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    const tempOptions: Record\u003cstring, string\u003e = {}\n    for (const option of selectedVariant.options) {\n      tempOptions[option.option_id] = option.value\n    }\n\n    if (!isEqual(tempOptions, options)) {\n      updateOptions(tempOptions)\n    }\n  }, [selectedVariant.options, options])\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv className=\"flex flex-col gap-y-2\"\u003e\n      \u003cinput type=\"number\" min=\"1\" max={selectedVariant.inventory_quantity} value={quantity} disabled={!inStock}\n        onChange={(e) =\u003e setQuantity(parseInt(e.target.value))} className=\"border p-2 w-max mt-2\" /\u003e\n      \u003cButton onClick={addToCart} className=\"w-max my-2\"\u003e\n        {!inStock ? \"Out of stock\" : \"Add to cart\"}\n      \u003c/Button\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport default ProductActions\n```\n\nThis component uses the `useProductActions` hook which exposes the values in the `ProductContext`. In `useEffect`, it preselects the options in the current variant.\n\nIt displays a quantity input and an add-to-cart button. Both the value of the quantity input and the add-to-cart handler are managed by `ProductContext`.\n\n### Create ProductPrice Component\n\nThe `ProductPrice` component handles showing the correct variant price to the customer.

It also shows pagination controls to move between different pages.\n\nFor each product, you loop over its variants and display them one by one in different rows. For each variant, you use the `ProductActions` and the `ProductPrice` components you created to show the quantity input, the add to cart button, and the variant’s price.\n\n### Change Store Page\n\nCurrently, the store page displays products in an infinite-scroll mode for all customers. You’ll change it to display the Products table for B2B customers, and the infinite-scroll mode for other customers.\n\nChange the content of `src/pages/store.tsx` to the following:\n\n```\nimport Head from \"@modules/common/components/head\"\nimport InfiniteProducts from \"@modules/products/components/infinite-products\"\nimport Layout from \"@modules/layout/templates\"\nimport { NextPageWithLayout } from \"types/global\"\nimport Products from \"@modules/wholesale/components/products\"\nimport RefinementList from \"@modules/store/components/refinement-list\"\nimport { StoreGetProductsParams } from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\nimport { useAccount } from \"@lib/context/account-context\"\nimport { useState } from \"react\"\n\nconst Store: NextPageWithLayout = () =\u003e {\n  const [params, setParams] = useState\u003cStoreGetProductsParams\u003e({})\n  const { is_b2b } = useAccount()\n\n  return (\n    \u003c\u003e\n      {!is_b2b \u0026\u0026 (\n        \u003c\u003e\n          \u003cHead title=\"Store\" description=\"Explore all of our products.\" /\u003e\n          \u003cdiv className=\"flex flex-col small:flex-row small:items-start py-6\"\u003e\n            \u003cRefinementList refinementList={params} setRefinementList={setParams} /\u003e\n            \u003cInfiniteProducts params={params} /\u003e\n          \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003c/\u003e\n      )}\n      {is_b2b \u0026\u0026 (\n        \u003c\u003e\n          \u003cHead title=\"Wholesale Products\" description=\"Explore all of our products.\" /\u003e\n          \u003cdiv className=\"flex flex-col small:flex-row small:items-start py-6\"\u003e\n            \u003cProducts params={{\n              ...params,\n              sales_channel_id: [process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SALES_CHANNEL_ID || \"\"]\n            }} /\u003e\n          \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003c/\u003e\n      )}\n    \u003c/\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nStore.getLayout = (page) =\u003e \u003cLayout\u003e{page}\u003c/Layout\u003e\n\nexport default Store\n```\n\nYou first retrieve `is_b2b` from `useAccount`. Then, if `is_b2b` is false, you display the `InfiniteProducts` component. Otherwise, for B2B customers, you display the `Products` component that you created.\n\n### Change Store Dropdown\n\nWhen you hover over the Store link in the navigation bar, it currently shows a dropdown with some products and collections. As this is distracting for B2B customers, you’ll remove it for them.\n\nIn `src/modules/layout/components/dropdown-menu/index.tsx`, retrieve the `is_b2b` variable from the `AccountContext`:\n\n```\nimport { useAccount } from \"@lib/context/account-context\"\n//...\n\nconst DropdownMenu = () =\u003e {\n\tconst { is_b2b } = useAccount()\n\t//...\n}\n```\n\nAnd change the returned JSX to the following:\n\n```\nconst DropdownMenu = () =\u003e {\n\t//...\n\treturn (\n    \u003c\u003e\n      {is_b2b \u0026\u0026 (\n        \u003cdiv className=\"h-full flex\"\u003e\n

Otherwise, `is_b2b` is shown.\n\n### Test Products Page\n\nMake sure your Medusa server is still running and restart your Next.js storefront.\n\nThen, open the Next.js storefront and, after logging in as a B2B customer, click on the Store link in the navigation bar at the top left. You’ll see your list of product variants in a table.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-10-19\\_at\\_2.40.51\\_PM.png)\n\n\n\nNotice how the prices of the variants are different than those shown to other customers. These prices are the prices you defined in the B2B Price List.\n\nYou can also test the prices with quantity-based conditions you added to the Price List. For example, if the condition was that product Medusa Hoodie’s variant S should have a different price if its quantity in the cart is more than 10, try changing the quantity to 10 or more and clicking Add to Cart. You’ll see a different price for that variant in the cart.\n\n## Test Checkout Flow\n\nThe checkout flow is pretty similar to those of regular customers:\n\n*   Add a couple of items to the cart from the table.\n*   Click on the My Bag link at the top right of the navigation bar.\n*   Click on Go to Checkout.\n*   Fill out the Shipping Address information and choose a Fulfillment method.\n*   Choose a payment method. Since in this tutorial you didn’t add any payment methods, you’ll use the manual payment method. However, you can integrate many other payment methods with Medusa such as [Stripe](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/stripe) or [PayPal](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/paypal), or [create your own](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/payment/how-to-create-payment-provider).\n*   Click on the Checkout button.\n\nThis places the order on the Medusa server. Please note that Medusa does not capture the payment when an order is placed; it only authorizes it. You’ll need to capture it from the Medusa admin.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Recording\\_2022-10-19\\_at\\_2.55.22\\_PM.gif)\n\n\n\n## View Order Details on Medusa Admin\n\nRun both the Medusa server and Medusa admin you created in part 1. Then, access the Medusa admin on `localhost:7000`.\n\nAfter logging in, you should see the list of orders in your store. In the list, you can see the payment status of the order, the sales channel, and more.\n\nYou should find the order you just created in the list. Click on the order to view its details.\n\nOn the order details page, you can see all the details of the order such as the items ordered, the payment and fulfillment details, the customer’s details, and more.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-10-19\\_at\\_3.11.03\\_PM.png)\n\n\n\n### Capture Payment\n\nTo capture the payment of the order:\n\n1.  Scroll to the Payment section.\n2.  Click on the Capture Payment.\n\nIf you chose the Test payment provider during checkout, this will not actually do anything other than change the payment status of the order. If you’re using other payment providers such as Stripe, this is when the payment will actually be captured.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy following this two-part tutorial series, you should have the basis of a B2B ecommerce store built with Medusa. You can perform much more customizations and add additional features to your store including:\n\n1.  Add a payment provider. As mentioned, you can add payment providers like [Stripe](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/stripe) and [PayPal](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/paypal), or [create your own](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/payment/how-to-create-payment-provider).\n2.  [Create a Fulfillment Provider](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/shipping/add-fulfillment-provider).\n3.  Integrate search engines such as [Algolia](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/algolia) or [MeiliSearch](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/meilisearch).\n\n\u003e Should you have any issues or questions related to Medusa, then feel free to reach out to the Medusa team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp).\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/docker-ecommerce-website.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/docker-ecommerce-website.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/docker-ecommerce-website.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Create an Ecommerce Website with Docker","date":"2022-11-29","excerpt":"Learn how to set up the Medusa backend server with Docker by running only a few commands.","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/medusa-docker-min.jpg","altText":"Create an Ecommerce Website with Docker","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-ns0w0s3w2.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-ns0w0s3w2.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-ns0w0s3w2.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Ashutosh","lastName":"Krishna","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/ashu-dp.jpg","altText":"Person photo"}}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-29bs7fo47.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json"},"type":"Category","name":"Community"},"markdown_content":"\n\u003ccallout icon=\"exclamationCircleSolid\" button-label=\"Go to Docs\" button-url=\"http://docs.medusajs.com\"\u003e\n**Notice**\nMedusa is under active development, so the content of this post may be outdated. Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\n[Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) is an open source headless ecommerce platform that allows developers to create their own customizable and extendable online store. With Medusa, developers can have a fun time building distinctive e-commerce sites.\n\nMedusa is composed of three components: the headless backend, the admin dashboard, and the storefront.\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll set up the Medusa backend server with Docker by running only a few commands. You’ll then install the admin and storefront and link them to the Medusa server.\n\n## What is Docker?\n\nDocker is an open source containerization tool that allows you to build, test, deploy, and manage applications quickly using lightweight virtualized environments called containers.\n\nThese *Docker containers* have everything that the application needs to run, including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Docker containers are based on *Docker images*.\n\nA Docker image is a template file that acts as a set of instructions to run containers. The easiest way to build a Docker image is by using a plain-text file called *Dockerfile* that contains all the specifications for creating the image.\n\nA simple Dockerfile looks like the following:\n\n```\nFROM alpine\nCMD [\"echo\", \"Hello Medusa!\"]\n```\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore continuing in this article, you need to install a few tools and software:\n\n1.  Node.js: You need Node.js and NPM to install [@medusajs/medusa-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@medusajs/medusa-cli). If you haven’t installed Node.js yet, install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).\n2.  Git: Git is a version control system. Medusa uses it behind the scenes while creating a project. You can install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).\n3.  Docker: You need Docker to set up your server. You can download and install Docker on your system from [here](https://www.docker.com/).\n\n## Setting up Your Development Server with Docker\n\nOnce you have installed the tools from the prerequisites section, you are good to follow along to set up your development server with Docker.\n\nInstall the Medusa CLI using the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install -g @medusajs/medusa-cl\n```\n\nNow that you have installed the Medusa CLI, create a new Medusa project using the following command:\n\n```\nmedusa new my-medusa-store\n```\n\nOnce the project is created, go to the newly-created project directory named `my-medusa-store`. This directory will have the following files and folders:\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2022-10-22\\_001730.png)\n\nNow, you can find some familiar files like `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` as seen above. The explanation of these files is beyond the scope of this article. For the time being, you should just understand that the Dockerfile is used to build the image for the Medusa server.\n\nIn addition to this, the compose file also includes two images, Postgres and Redis, which are essential for running the server.\n\nNow that you have a Docker Compose file, you can run a container. Before running any Docker container, make sure your Docker Desktop is running successfully.\n\nAs already discussed, you need to create the image yourself; use the following command to build the image and run containers using that image:\n\n```\ndocker compose up --build\n```\n\nThe command will take some time to build the image and run the required containers. If you see the following output at the end, then your local Medusa server is up and running on port `9000`.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2022-10-22\\_003255.png)\n\nIf you get any error saying `./develop.sh: no such file or directory`, then replace the last line in the Dockerfile with the following:\n\n```\nENTRYPOINT [\"sh\", \"develop.sh\"]\n```\n\nOnce done, run the previous command again to start your containers.\n\nYour server database is empty of data as of now.\n\nYou can optionally seed your server with demo data. Since the server is running inside a Docker container, you will need to execute the seed command inside that container.\n\nRun the following command in a different terminal to seed your database with demo data:\n\n```\ndocker exec medusa-server-default medusa seed -f ./data/seed.json\n```\n\n## Test Your Medusa Server\n\nOnce you have the server up and running, you are ready to test your Medusa server. You can go to \u003chttp://localhost:9000/store/products\u003e on your browser to check whether you have set up your server correctly. If you haven’t seeded the database in the previous step, you will see the below output:\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2022-11-03\\_151144.png)\n\nHowever, if you seeded the database, you will see JSON data with an array of products and other details.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2022-11-03\\_151734.png)\n\nCongratulations, you just set up your first Medusa server with Docker!\n\n## Set up your Next.js Storefront\n\nIn this section, you’ll to set up your Next.js Storefront to provide your customers with a great experience browsing your ecommerce store.\n\nFirst, clone the Next.js Starter Medusa repository from GitHub using the command:\n\n```\nnpx create-next-app -e https://github.com/medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa my-medusa-storefront\n```\n\nNext, navigate into the cloned repository folder and get your environment variables ready using the command:\n\n```\ncd my-medusa-storefront/\nmv .env.template .env.local \n```\n\nNow you are ready to start up your project using the command:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\n### Test Storefront\n\nOnce the frontend server starts up, you can visit `http://localhost:8000/store` on your browser to see your products. Your storefront will look similar to the below:\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2022-11-04\\_170753-b0152767.png)\n\nIf you look clearly, these are the same products that your server has returned in JSON format.\n\n## Set up Medusa Admin\n\nIn this step, you’re going to set up Medusa Admin. Medusa Admin allows you to manage your ecommerce store’s data including products, orders, settings, and more.\n\nTo start with, clone the Medusa Admin repository on GitHub and navigate to the cloned repository folder:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/medusajs/admin.git\ncd admin\n```\n\nNext, install all the dependencies using the NPM command:\n\n```\nnpm install\n```\n\nFurther, start the development server for Medusa Admin:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\n### Test Admin\n\nOnce the development server starts up, you can visit \u003chttp://localhost:7000\u003e to see your admin panel. The admin panel initially asks you for login credentials. If you have already seeded the data, the admin username is *admin@medusa-test.com* and the password is *supersecret*.\n\nHowever, if you haven’t seeded the data, you can create an admin user by running the below command on the Medusa server:\n\n```\nmedusa user -e admin@email.com -p some-password\n```\n\nOnce the admin user is created, you can log in and start adding products as shown in the demo below:\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CJuBwLDJoZI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nNote that in the above demo, the server has data already seeded.\n\n## Additional Configurations\n\nYou can set the environment variables used in the project by changing their values in the `docker-compose.yml` file. The `docker-compose.yml` file contains an environment section in the different services wherein all of your environment variables used by that specific container are mentioned.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2022-11-03\\_145918.png)\n\nYou can add a new environment variable as `KEY`: `VALUE`. An example of the same is given below:\n\n```\nenvironment:\n\t...other environment variables...\n\tMY_VAR: ABCD123\n```\n\nIn the above example, `MY_VAR` is the name of the environment variable and `ABCD123` is the value of that environment variable.\n\nOnce you run a Docker container using this `docker-compose.yml` file, your container will have these environment variables already set.\n\nYou can learn about adding more configurations to your Medusa server in [this documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/usage/configurations/).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDocker makes it very easy to pack, ship, and deliver code. In this tutorial, you set up your first Medusa server with Docker by running just a few commands.\n\nYou can check out [Medusa’s documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/) to learn more about Medusa and its features. You can explore more about Docker in [their documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).\n\n\u003e Should you have any issues or questions related to Medusa, then feel free to reach out to the Medusa team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp).\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/engineering-interview-process.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/engineering-interview-process.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/engineering-interview-process.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Our engineering interview process","date":"2022-11-23","excerpt":"This post is dedicated to engineers considering applying for a position at Medusa and wanting to know what’s in store and how to best prepare.","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/engineering-interview-process (1).png","altText":"engineering-process-thumbnail","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json"},"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Juhl","role":"CTO \u0026 Co-founder","image":{"url":"/images/oli.jpeg","altText":"Oliver Juhl"},"type":"Person","bio":"CTO \u0026 Co-founder of Medusa\n"}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-a9wemp4po.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json"},"name":"Other","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"Over the last couple of months, we have been building out our engineering organization and conducted hundreds of interviews. We have observed that covering process structure takes up significant and valuable time during interviews. Therefore, I’ve decided to outline our interview process here, hoping it can serve as a source of alignment prior to starting the process.\n\nThis post is dedicated to engineers considering applying for a position at Medusa and wanting to know what’s in store and how to best prepare.\n\n### Overview\n\nOur process is straightforward, and the interviews that all engineering candidates go through do not differ wildly from the rest of the industry. Below you’ll find a diagram depicting the process; four interviews are fixed, while one depends on the role we are hiring for. The offer letter is presented during the final call and is contingent on reference calls we’ll conduct within the following week or two. We might also squeeze in calls with our team, but this varies from candidate to candidate.\n\nThis post will cover the intro, technical case, and culture fit interviews.\n\n![](/images/interview-process-81b44830.png)\n\n### The intro call\n\n**Expected outcome**\n\nThe introductory call is for us to get to know each other. We introduce ourselves and talk about Medusa and your motivation for applying. At the end of the call, we dedicate time for you to ask questions about our organization, the product, and the team to ensure nothing is left unanswered when we conclude.\n\n**Format**\n\nFor all engineering positions, the intro call is with me (CTO) and lasts 30 minutes. We run introductions in a conversational format, asking questions to one another as we go along.\n\n**Preparing for the interview**\n\nWe will spend time talking about our product, so I recommend reading through our [website](https://medusajs.com/), [Notion Home](https://www.notion.so/Medusa-Home-3485f8605d834a07949b17d1a9f7eafd), and [GitHub](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) to get a high-level idea of what we build, how we differentiate, and why. The idea is to form a foundation for a good conversation.\n\nAdditionally, It is worth considering why you want to join Medusa. We are a fast-growing, early-stage startup with under 20 people in our organization. This implies more responsibility, taking ownership of tasks, and being receptive to constant change, which is not necessarily for everyone.\n\n### Technical case\n\n**Expected outcome**\n\nOur technical case might differ from what you’ve seen elsewhere. We don’t believe fizz-buzz-like coding challenges help us hire exceptional engineers, and they give you no idea about how it is to work at Medusa.\n\nIn our engineering organization, we follow an [RFC approach](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/scaling-engineering-teams-via-writing-things-down-rfcs/) to solution design. You will be exposed to that framework in the technical case interview as it is structured around a feature in our backlog. You will be asked to design a solution, write a (small) RFC, and document your thought process as if you were part of the team.\n\nThe purpose is to evaluate your technical competencies, product sense, and ability to communicate in a scenario similar to our daily work.\n\n**Format**\n\nThe format of the technical case comprises a take-home task and a 60-minute review call. Usually, we schedule the review call a week after you’ve received the take-home case. To be clear, we don’t expect you to spend seven days on the case, but the timing allows you to stretch the work over multiple days.\n\nYou’ll receive the task in a [Product Requirements Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mEMDcHmtQ6twzNlpvF-9maNlAcezpWDtCnyIqWkODZs/edit) (PRD) format, which is almost always the input to our solution design framework. In the review call, we’ll spend the first half discussing your solution proposal and the other half talking more generally about engineering.\n\nThe interview will involve a Senior Engineer (or our CEO, Seb) and me.\n\n**Preparing for the interview**\n\nAs our technical case is a feature from our backlog, you can check it out before applying. The current one in question is an [extension to our Product API](https://www.notion.so/Case-Software-Engineer-Core-32e78b8e409e41e3b9797256167fbfc8).\n\nAside from reading through the feature document, I recommend familiarising yourself with our technical stack, as we will likely relate your design proposal directly to our product and architecture.\n\nAs for the second part of the interview, we’ll discuss engineering and product learnings from your previous experience.\n\nSome of the questions we focus on are:\n\n*   What’s an example of an exciting problem that you’ve solved?\n\n*   What’s an example of a problem you've had to solve quickly?\n\n*   What’s an example of something you’ve learned that you want to bring to Medusa?\n\n*   What’s an example of something you’ve done that had a high impact?\n\nAnd we approach them from an engineering perspective.\n\n### Culture fit\n\n**Expected outcome**\n\nEngineering capabilities and product sense are two important characteristics that we value highly in a candidate, but collaboration and communication are equally important, as we will be spending most of our time together over the next many years.\n\nThe culture fit interview serves two purposes; it is for us to understand what learnings and values from your experience you will bring with you to Medusa, and an opportunity for you to gauge if our team and culture constitute a work environment you see yourself part of.\n\n**Format**\n\nThis interview is conducted by one of my co-founders and me. In the call, we ask questions about a selection of past teams you have been part of and your role in those teams.\n\nWe set aside at least 15 minutes for you to ask questions before we wrap up the interview.\n\n**Preparing for the interview**\n\nThe best preparation for the culture fit interview is to reflect on your career learnings and consider the characteristics of a healthy work environment and overall team culture.\n\nSimilar to the technical discussion, we have a set of questions (for each of the selected previous employments) that are almost always covered, and those are:\n\n*   What were you hired to do?\n\n*   What team were you part of, and what was your role?\n\n*   What were your most significant accomplishments?\n\n*   What were your biggest challenges?\n\n*   What would you bring from your time at “X” company?\n\n### Let’s chat!\n\nWe believe [companies (and their success) are a product of the team they build](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-hire), so we spend tremendous time fine-tuning our process to give us the best basis for making decisions.

Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\nMedusa is an open source Node.js ecommerce platform that facilitates the creation of modern ecommerce stores with composable architecture, good developer experience, and advanced ecommerce features.\n\nAlthough Magento is a platform that provides many [advanced ecommerce features](https://medusajs.com/blog/medusa-vs-magento-comparing-two-open-source-ecommerce-frameworks/), it’s a traditional platform that fails to keep up with the rapidly-advancing digital trends. It’s also widely known how difficult it is to use for developers.\n\nIn this article, I’ll share with you my latest Medusa plugin, [Magento Source Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/medusa-source-magento), which allows you to import your products and categories from Magento into Medusa.\n\n## Why Migrate to Medusa\n\nMedusa and Magento both provide essential ecommerce features. However, some of Medusa’s advantages include:\n\n*   Composable Architecture: Medusa’s composable architecture speeds up development processes and gives absolute freedom in building the full architecture of the ecommerce system.\n*   Flexibility and Customization: You have full freedom in choosing what components go into your tech stack, including the storefront framework, third-party services, and custom features you want to build into your store.\n*   Use of Modern Technologies: Since you have full freedom to pick the different components of your tech stack, you can use modern technologies such as Jamstack storefronts. You can also constantly update the different components of your stack independent of one another.\n\n## Magento Source Plugin\n\nThe [Magento source plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/medusa-source-magento) is a plugin that you can install on a Medusa server to import your products and categories from a deployed Magento store. This plugin facilitates your move from a Magento store to a Medusa store.\n\n### Limitations\n\nMagento has 6 product types. As some of those types don't exist in Medusa, only the Configurable and Simple products can be imported.\n\nSimple and Configurable products that are part of Bundled or Grouped products will still be imported into Medusa.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nYou must have a Medusa server installed. You can follow the [Quickstart guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start) to install a Medusa server in three steps.\n\nFurthermore, the Medusa server should have [PostgreSQL](https://docs.medusajs.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment#postgresql) and [Redis](https://docs.medusajs.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment#redis) installed and configured on your Medusa server.\n\n### Create Magento Integration\n\nFor Medusa to connect to Magento’s APIs, you need to create an integration in Magento. You’ll then receive the authentication keys that you need for the Medusa plugin.\n\nLog in to your Magento admin, then go to System -\u003e Integrations and click on Add New Integrations.\n\nYou need to give the integration access to the following resources:\n\n*   Catalog (with its child resources).\n*   Stores -\u003e Settings (with its child resources).\n*   Stores -\u003e Attributes (with its child resources).\n\nOnce you’re done, click Save.\n\n![](/images/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-04%20at%203.13.00%20PM.png)\n\nThen, on the Integrations listing page, click on the Activate link. Click on the Allow button to confirm allowing access to the requested resources.\n\nYou’ll then see four keys: Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token, and Access Token Secret. You’ll need these keys for the Medusa plugin.\n\n### Install Magento Source Plugin\n\nOn your Medusa server, run the following command to install the Magento Source plugin:\n\n```\nnpm install medusa-source-magento\n```\n\nThen, in `.env`, add the following environment variables:\n\n```\nMAGENTO_URL=\u003cYOUR_MAGENTO_URL\u003e\nCONSUMER_KEY=\u003cINTEGRATION_CONSUMER_KEY\u003e\nCONSUMER_SECRET=\u003cINTEGRATION_CONSUMER_SECRET\u003e\nACCESS_TOKEN=\u003cINTEGRATION_ACCESS_TOKEN\u003e\nACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=\u003cINTEGRATION_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET\u003e\n\n# optional\nMAGENTO_IMAGE_PREFIX=\u003cYOUR_MAGENTO_IMAGE_PREFIX\u003e\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n*   `\u003cYOUR_MAGENTO_URL\u003e` is the URL of your Magento service. It shouldn’t end with a backslash.\n*   `\u003cINTEGRATION_CONSUMER_KEY\u003e`, `\u003cINTEGRATION_CONSUMER_SECRET\u003e`, `\u003cINTEGRATION_ACCESS_TOKEN\u003e`, `\u003cINTEGRATION_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET\u003e` are the keys you received after creating the integration\n*   `\u003cYOUR_MAGENTO_IMAGE_PREFIX\u003e` is optional and should only be used if you don’t use Magento’s default media storage. If you use, for example, S3, then you should include the URL prefix of media files here to retrieve the images properly.\n\nNext, add the following in `medusa-config.js` to the `plugins` array:\n\n```\nconst plugins = [\n  //...\n  {\n    resolve: `medusa-source-magento`,\n    //if your plugin has configurations\n    options: {\n      magento_url: process.env.MAGENTO_URL,\n      consumer_key: process.env.CONSUMER_KEY,\n      consumer_secret: process.env.CONSUMER_SECRET,\n      access_token: process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN,\n      access_token_secret: process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET,\n\t\t\t//optional\n      image_prefix: process.env.MAGENTO_IMAGE_PREFIX\n    },\n  },\n];\n```\n\nIf you didn’t add the `MAGENTO_IMAGE_PREFIX` environment variable then don’t pass the `image_prefix` property.\n\n## How to Use the Plugin\n\n### Server Start-Up\n\nAfter installing the plugin, every time you start the Medusa server the plugin will import the products and categories from Magento in the background.\n\nYou can start the Medusa server with the following command:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nYou can check that the products are added either using the [List Products endpoint](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store/#tag/Product/operation/GetProducts) or using the Medusa Admin.\n\n![](/images/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-04%20at%203.33.30%20PM.png)\n\n### Triggering Import\n\nAlternatively, you can trigger importing products while the Medusa server is running using Batch Jobs. Batch Jobs in Medusa allows you to run an extensive task asynchronously.\n\nTo trigger an import, send a request to the [Create Batch Job endpoint](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin/#tag/Batch-Job/operation/PostBatchJobs) with the following payload:\n\n```\n{\n    \"type\": \"import-magento\",\n    \"context\": { },\n    \"dry_run\": false\n}\n```\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nYou can do so much more with Medusa after importing your data! You can:\n\n*   Install the [Next.js](https://docs.medusajs.com/starters/nextjs-medusa-starter) or [Gatsby](https://docs.medusajs.com/starters/gatsby-medusa-starter) storefronts.\n*   Install the [Medusa Admin](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/quickstart).\n*   Check other plugins such as [Stripe](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/stripe), [SendGrid](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/sendgrid), and [Algolia](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/algolia).\n\n\u003e Should you have any issues or questions related to Medusa, then feel free to reach out to the Medusa team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp).\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/medusa-webhooks-best-technical-project-of-medusa-hackathon.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/medusa-webhooks-best-technical-project-of-medusa-hackathon.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/medusa-webhooks-best-technical-project-of-medusa-hackathon.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Medusa Webhooks: The Best Technical Project of the Medusa Hackathon","date":"2022-11-10","excerpt":"All the details on how I built Medusa Webhooks and won the Best Technical Project in the Medusa Hackathon","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/webhooks-min.jpg","altText":"Medusa Webhooks: The Best Technical Project of the Medusa Hackathon","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-di58u2z09.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-di58u2z09.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-di58u2z09.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Anish","lastName":"De","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/pfp-face-1.png","altText":"Person photo"}}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-a9wemp4po.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json"},"name":"Other","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"Extensibility is one of the core features of [Medusa](https://medusajs.com/), an open source headless ecommerce engine, and it has enabled developers to create plugins for Medusa. This infinitely increases the potential for what can be done with Medusa.\n\nWebhooks are web requests that are triggered on certain events. They allow applications to communicate with each other easily. Medusa has great potential for using webhooks to communicate with other services, so I decided to build the [Medusa Webhooks Plugin](https://github.com/AnishDe12020/medusa-plugin-webhooks) for the [Medusa Hackathon during Hacktoberfest 2022](https://medusajs.com/blog/medusa-hackathon).\n\nThis Webhooks Plugin allows you to add webhook triggers for order-related events on your store. The possibilities which can be achieved are endless. It can be anything from sending a confirmation email to the customer to airdropping them an NFT.\n\n## My Experience Working on This Project\n\nI was able to learn a lot about the inner workings of Medusa when working on this project. It proved to be a great learning experience for me and an opportunity to make something for the community.\n\n## My Experience Creating the Plugin\n\nMedusa has great documentation and guides for working with it. Although I had minor hiccups when creating the plugin, I was able to work my way out by looking at how the official plugins were implemented.\n\n### How I Created the Plugin\n\nI started out by following the [Create a Plugin guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/plugins/create) for the plugin. I followed the [Quickstart](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start) and [Set Up Dev Environment](https://docs.medusajs.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment) guides to set up a local store for me to test my plugin. I also set up [Medusa Admin](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/quickstart) and a [Next.js storefront](https://docs.medusajs.com/starters/nextjs-medusa-starter). While setting up the store, I also added the `--seed` flag, which added some dummy products to the store so that I didn’t have to add products manually. This process took only approximately 15 minutes.\n\nI encountered some hiccups during the development process and that is when the [Notifications Service Reference](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/services/classes/NotificationService) and a sneak peek at the implementations of the official plugins came in handy.\n\n## What Does the Webhook Plugin do?\n\nThe plugin lets you set up webhook triggers on order events (order being placed, cancelled, updated, or completed) in your store. For example, if you would like to send an email to the customer when they place an order successfully, you could set up an api route which sends out the email to the customer.\n\nThe plugin will send a request to this API route along with the order and customer data which can be used by your code in determining whom to send the email to along with what the message should contain.\n\nYou can also pass in headers to go along with the request. This is useful when you have to send a secret key for authentication. The default webhook URL and headers can also be overridden on an event basis.\n\nThe plugin service also exposes a `postWebhook` method that can be used to trigger webhooks from your custom code in the Medusa store.\n\n## Using the Plugin\n\nBefore trying to use the plugin, here are some things you must have.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n*   A Medusa server ([Quickstart Guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start/))\n*   Redis setup on your Medusa server ([Configuring Redis on your Medusa server](https://docs.medusajs.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment/#redis))\n*   A webhook endpoint to which you can post webhooks (for testing purposes, I recommend using [Svix Play](https://play.svix.com/))\n\n### Installing and Setting up the Webhooks Plugin\n\nTo install the plugin using NPM, run the following command in your Medusa server directory:\n\n```\nnpm install medusa-plugin-webhooks\n```\n\nIf you prefer using Yarn, run the following command in your Medusa server directory:\n\n```\nyarn add medusa-plugin-webhooks\n```\n\nOnce the plugin is installed, we need to add it to the `plugins` array in the `medusa-config.js` file in your Medusa server directory:\n\n```\nconst plugins = [\n  ...{\n    resolve: \"medusa-plugin-webhooks\",\n    options: {\n      webhook_url: \"https://mystore.com/events\", // REQUIRED: CHANGE THIS TO A VALID WEBHOOK ENDPOINT\n      webhook_headers: {\n        \"x-api-key\": \"supersecretapikey\", // OPTIONAL: You can add custom headers (for example, for authentication)\n      },\n      webhook_config: {\n        \"order.placed\": {\n          enabled: true,\n          overrideUrl: \"\u003chttps://mystore.com/events/order-placed\u003e\", // OPTIONAL: You can override the URL on a per-event basis,\n          overrideHeaders: {\n            \"x-api-key\": \"supersecretorderplacedapikey\", // OPTIONAL: You can override the headers on a per-event basis\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n];\n```\n\nCurrently, these four (4) events are supported:\n\n*   `order.placed`\n*   `order.updated`\n*   `order.completed`\n*   `order.canceled`\n\nBy default, notifications for all events are disabled. To enable notifications for any of the above events, set the `enabled` property to `true` in the `webhook_config` object (see example config above).\n\nYou can override the URL or headers for any of the above events by setting the `overrideUrl` or `overrideHeaders` properties in the `webhook_config` object (see example config above).\n\n### Triggering a Webhook Request from Your Custom Code\n\nYou can trigger a webhook request from your code by resolving the webhook service and then using the `postWebhook` function. For example:\n\n```\nconst webhooksService = scope.resolve(\"webhooksService\");\nawait webhooksService.postWebhook(\n  {\n    event: \"order.placed\",\n    data: {\n      order_id: \"order_id\",\n      customer_id: \"customer_id\",\n      total_price: 1000,\n      currency_code: \"USD\",\n    },\n  },\n  \"mystore.com/events/custom\", // OPTIONAL: You can pass in an URL override here as well\n  {\n    \"x-api-key\": \"customeventsapikey\", // OPTIONAL: You can pass in custom headers here as well\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSetting up this plugin is a quick and easy task.

Medusa enables developers to build scalable and sophisticated commerce setups with low effort and great developer experience.\n\n[Paystack](https://paystack.com/) allows African businesses to accept payments in local and foreign currencies from multiple local and global payment channels.\n\nAs our submission for the Medusa Hackathon, we built [Medusa-Payment-Paystack](https://github.com/a11rew/medusa-payment-paystack), a plugin that adds Paystack as a payment provider to Medusa ecommerce stores. \n\nWith our plugin, African business owners can create ecommerce stores on Medusa and accept payments in local currencies tailored to the 236 million (2022) and counting ecommerce users in Africa.\n\n## Experience Working on the Hackathon\n\nWorking on the Medusa hackathon was a great experience for both of us. We met on the Medusa Discord server and decided to work together on a submission for the hackathon. \n\nWe were both familiar with Paystack, being that they operated in both our countries (Ghana \u0026 Nigeria), and decided it would be useful to build a payment plugin integrated with Paystack to enable Medusa store purchases in our local currencies. \n\nWe decided on our high-level goals; feature parity with the existing Stripe payment plugin, high code coverage, and a really good developer experience. We then broke those down into measurable tasks we split among each other and worked on in short sprints.\n\nWe met regularly to catch up on progress and unblock each other where necessary. We had a great time working together and learned a lot from each other.\n\n## Experience developing with Medusa\n\nOur development process began by identifying and getting familiar with the Medusa user flows our payment plugin would be integrated into. These turned out to be the checkout flow and the admin order management system. \n\nUsers should be able to pay for items in Medusa stores and store owners should be able to view order payments and issue refunds. Our plugin would take care of everything.\n\nWe went to work getting familiar with the APIs Medusa provides developers that would allow our plugin to perform the aforementioned tasks.\n\nThe Medusa docs were a godsend for us as first-time users of the platform. There were docs for practically everything we needed and we found the dependency injection mechanism that allowed core Medusa services like the Cart service (we use this in verifying payment amount values) to be used in plugins particularly useful.\n\nAfter figuring out what needed to be done on Medusa’s end of things we integrated Paystack using the `paystack-api` package, a Node.js wrapper for the Paystack API, calling the relevant Paystack API endpoints as appropriate.\n\n## What are the plugin's features?\n\nWhen you install and choose Paystack as your payment provider for your Medusa ecommerce store, you are guaranteed the following features:\n\n### Connect Medusa to Paystack\n\nUsing [Medusa-Payment-Paystack](https://github.com/a11rew/medusa-payment-paystack), you can effortlessly integrate Paystack with Medusa, add Paystack as a payment provider in a region, and include Paystack in your checkout flow using the `provider_id` of Paystack. Payments to your Paystack business made from your Medusa store show up on your admin panel automatically. Refunds too. \n\n### Verify purchases\n\nIn the payment completion callback of your chosen flow, you can call the Medusa [Complete Cart](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/storefront/how-to-implement-checkout-flow/#complete-cart) method. When you use the reference provided by [Medusa-Payment-Paystack](https://github.com/a11rew/medusa-payment-paystack), The transaction status is checked, verifies the amount matches the cart total, and marks the cart paid for within Medusa.\n\n### Issue refunds\n\nThe admin dashboard allows you to refund captured payments made with Paystack.\n\nA refund will occur using [Medusa-Payment-Paystack](https://github.com/a11rew/medusa-payment-paystack), which marks the order in Medusa as refunded using Paystack.\n\nIn addition, all Paystack's checkout flows (popups, redirects, APIs) are made available by the plugin.\n\n## How to use the plugin\n\nAdding support for Paystack payments to your Medusa store using the [Medusa-Payment-Paystack](https://github.com/a11rew/medusa-payment-paystack) plugin involves three main steps:\n\n1. Adding Paystack as a payment provider in your Medusa server\n    - This involves installing the plugin from NPM using the command `npm install medusa-payment-paystack`\n    - Adding the plugin to your list of plugins in `medusa.config.js`\n- Adding Paystack to the region\n    - In the Medusa admin dashboard, choose the regions you want to enable Paystack in and select the Paystack option in `Payment Providers`.\n- Integrating into the checkout flow\n    - Use the reference the plugin injects into your Payment Session data when initializing the payment with Paystack.\n    - Call Medusa’s complete cart method after the user successfully completes payment. The plugin will take it from there, handling reporting the order as paid for in Medusa, verifying amounts, and processing refunds if necessary.\n\nWe also made a [video walking you through these steps](https://vimeo.com/763132960).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFor more detailed steps on setting up the Paystack plugin, you can visit the project’s [README](https://github.com/a11rew/medusa-payment-paystack#readme) for detailed steps.\n\nIf you’d also like to dive directly into code, check out [medusa-paystack-demo](https://github.com/a11rew/medusa-paystack-demo) - a demo Medusa store with Paystack configured as a payment provider using `medusa-payment-paystack`. \n\n\u003e Should you have any issues or questions related to Medusa, then feel free to reach out to the Medusa team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp)."},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/9-user-experience-best-practices-for-ecommerce.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/9-user-experience-best-practices-for-ecommerce.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/9-user-experience-best-practices-for-ecommerce.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"9 UX Best Practices for Ecommerce","date":"2022-11-03","excerpt":"Here are 9 best practices you should follow in your ecommerce store.","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/ux-ecommerce-min.jpg","altText":"9 UX Best Practices for Ecommerce","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"seo_description":"Here are 9 best practices you should follow in your ecommerce store.","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-8so6wxsv1.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-8so6wxsv1.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-8so6wxsv1.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Safa","lastName":"Emhemed","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/IMG_20220302_093550 (1).jpg","altText":"Safa Emhemed"}}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-a9wemp4po.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json"},"name":"Other","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"Ecommerce is rapidly becoming the way you do business today. And one of the most important outcomes of this prosperity is a large number of customers. The biggest challenge is how to convert your visitors into customers.\n\nOne way you can gain customers is by building a well-developed ecommerce user experience. If your store doesn’t offer the best UX, all your efforts might go down the drain.\n\nLet’s look at why you need to care about UX, and how ecommerce designers can make the customer’s experience hassle-free.\n\n## What is Ecommerce User Experience (UX)?\n\nEcommerce user experience (UX) is defined as the overall experience of the visitor when interacting with your store, from the second the visitor loads your homepage, to the purchase, and even the post-purchase experience.\n\nThat is why it’s wise to focus on every element of UX, starting from performance and neat design, to clean navigation. The best ecommerce user experience aims to make the shopping experience as good as possible to drive potential customers to your products and services.\n\nImproving your ecommerce UX leads to more impulse purchases, less cart abandonment, high trust and confidence in your store, and higher overall conversion. So, it's important to follow the best practices when you build your ecommerce store.\n\n## 9 Best Ecommerce UX Practices\n\n### 1- Clean and Clear Homepage\n\nYour homepage is the first thing your customers see when they come across your store, and it’s usually the page that gets the most traffic. It’s crucial to make it look clean, uncluttered, and have a clear purpose.\n\nHere are some points to consider while building your homepage:\n\n*   Don't make it cluttered. Keep it offering minimum choice pathways. Don’t bog down your customer with too much information.\n*   Keep content short and to the point.\n*   Avoid pop-ups and forms. They distract your customers.\n*   Make your customer support contact information prominent through a [live-chat widget](https://medusajs.com/blog/chatwoot-ecommerce/) on your homepage.\n*   Keep your hero area streamlined and simple. The images should be relevant and meaningful to your ecommerce store. Use high-quality images and make them full-width.\n*   Keep the text on the hero image short, and relevant, and let there be a contrast between the text and the background.\n*   Always add Call-to-action buttons on your hero image. It ensures the highest chance of customers interacting with it.\n*   The visual hierarchy should follow the information hierarchy so customers naturally gravitate to the most important products first. You can do that by adjusting the position, color, or size of your products.\n\n### 2- Make Sure Your CTA Buttons Are Clear and Prominent\n\nCall-to-action (CTA) buttons are key to ecommerce success. They help customers to navigate your store and help you highlight the products and promotions. CTA in ecommerce generally is an “Add to Cart”, a “Buy Now”, or a “Checkout” button. Therefore, good CTA buttons would inspire your customers to take action and urge them to purchase.\n\nA good CTA should be:\n\n*   Noticeable and clickable.\n*   Readable with contrasting colors and bold lettering.\n*   Placed in the right place on the website or the application so that customers can find them quickly. For example, place “Sale” on the navigation bar to make customer access it easily. You can also place the “Sale” button on the hero area or in a wide section on the homepage.\n*   Be clear about what happens next. For example, the “Show Sales” button or tab will show your customer only the products in the sale, not any other products. Also, the “Shop Now” button should show your customer product listing page.\n*   Keep the wording short but with clear and common phrases. For example, use “Add to Cart” or “Buy Now” to add a product to the cart.\n\n### 3- Enable Search From All Pages\n\nIn ecommerce stores that sell a large number of products, the search bar is an essential way for customers to find the products that they are looking for.\n\nThese are some considerations to take when you design the search bar:\n\n*   Make the search bar prominent and ensure to use a background that makes it stand out. For example, make the field lighter and the background darker, which makes the customer catch it readily.\n*   If you use a search icon, you should make it easy to spot. For example, near the cart icon.\n*   Place the search on the top right or centralized.\n*   Use sticky search bars to ensure the search feature is available everywhere on all pages.\n*   Use autocomplete function to help customers search faster and fix spelling mistakes. For example, you can use [**Algolia**](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/algolia) for the best practices.\n*   Add filters when using the search bar to narrow search results.\n*   Use suggested results and autocorrect for human errors.\n*   Save customers’ search history.\n\n### 4- Make Your Product Listing Pages Informative\n\nThe product listing page is the most important page for customers. Not only do they use it to find the products they need, but they can use it to find products they didn’t know they needed.\n\nSome essentials to include are:\n\n*   Provide product images, prices, availability, and options (colors, sizes,...etc) on your listing pages.\n*   Show primary actions like “Add to Cart”, “Buy Now”, and “Add to Wishlist” buttons for each product. Place them prominently relative to the rest of the page content.\n*   Make the name of the product bold and the price of the product clear.\n*   Show products in grids and use a divider between products.\n*   Provide pagination to allow your customer to navigate between pages without struggle. Allow them to jump to specific pages within the results.\n*   Mark bestselling, recently launched, and out-of-stock products with unique tags or icons.\n*   Allow customers to sort products by price and rating.\n\n### 5- Use High-Quality Product Images and Strong Descriptions\n\nThe online shopping experience is limited on all fronts. Your customers can’t try on products and can’t feel or tangibly experience them. So, providing high-quality product images and strong-detailed descriptions help your customers get a better understanding of the products.\n\nHere are some tips to follow:\n\n*   Use large, high-resolution images with white backgrounds and good lighting.\n*   Add a zoom-in feature to allow customers to see product details clearly.\n*   Allow customers to scroll back and forth between images.\n*   The images should show different shots of the product from different angles, close-up images of its texture, and photos of the product in use.\n*   Use clear, well-written, and detailed product descriptions to assure your customers that your product is the right fit.\n*   Provide available product dimensions and colors.\n\n### 6- Show Product Reviews\n\nIncluding customer reviews on your product pages is a very powerful way to encourage customers to purchase. By displaying customer reviews on the product page, you’re showing new visitors that you’re a trustworthy seller.\n\nHere are some tips to ensure the best UX for product reviews:\n\n*   Show the rating average by stars.\n*   Pair the star rating with a review.\n*   Allow customers to submit photos and videos of the product they received.\n*   Show a questions and answers section.\n*   Place the ratings closer to the price. A high rating can encourage the customer to make the purchase.\n\n### 7- Highlight Deals and Promotions\n\nPromotions play an important role in attracting customers to your site and tempting them to purchase once they arrive.\n\nHere is how you can ensure that promotions are communicated effectively to your customers:\n\n*   Show a prominent sales and deals section on the homepage. It should be noticeable but shouldn’t compete with the homepage’s primary value proposition.\n*   Call-out deals with bright colors, bold text, and full-width photos.\n*   Show the discount percentage.\n*   Show the old price and the price after the discount, preferably in red color. Also, don’t hide the old price.\n*   Use countdown timers with the products that have sale periods to encourage customers to make a fast purchase decision.\n*   Be clear about the rules and conditions for special offers. For example, “buy one get one free” or “buy two get one free”.\n*   When you have an urgent or a seasonal sale, add an announcement bar or add a Sale button on the hero area with a catchy message.\n\n### 8- Make The Checkout Progress Straightforward\n\nThe more steps that stand between your customers and confirming their purchase, the higher the cart abandonment rate will be. Streamlining checkout makes the purchase process faster and prevents the customer from rethinking their decision.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to optimize the checkout process:\n\n*   Simplify the checkout process as much as possible. Skip steps that are not essential, and combine similar steps.\n*   Show the customer their progress and how much is left until they complete the purchase. That can be done with a progress bar, or numbered steps or stages.\n*   Ask for only the minimal required information, and clarify and indicate optionally and required information.\n*   Highlight the discount code field or coupon.\n*   Allow customers to use the sa billing address as the shipping address with one click.\n*   Offer different payment methods and third-party payment options backed by trusted companies, like PayPal’s OneTouch, Amazon, Android Pay, and Apple Pay.\n\n### 9- Don’t Force Customers to Register\n\nAccount creation can feel like a long process and include many steps. it might include the confirmation link or One Time Password (OTP), and this annoys customers who want just to purchase.\n\nFor an enjoyable experience, you can enable checkout as a guest. This further makes the checkout process simpler which leads to more purchases.\n\nHere are some tips to follow:\n\n*   Only require the customer’s email. You can also tie the address they enter to that email so that they can have the address auto-filled the next time they use the same email, even if they’re not logged in.\n*   Enable social login on the checkout screen to allow the user to register with one click.\n*   You can encourage the customer to register by letting them know that they can see their order history, track order details, get coupons, or mot.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe tips in this article provide a baseline of UX best practices that every ecommerce store should follow, but it’s just the beginning. In general, you have to follow UX standards, make your ecommerce store accessible, and make sure the performance and the security of your store meet the quality standards.\n\nGood ecommerce UX, in a growing and competitive market, is the ultimate advantage. It leads to higher conversion rates and more purchases.\n\nFor more useful tips on the success of your ecommerce store [subscribe to Medusa’s newsletter](https://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/newsletter) to get updates directly to your email, or just stay tuned on [our blog](https://medusajs.com/blog/).\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/ecommerce-storefront-medusa-strapi-remix.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/ecommerce-storefront-medusa-strapi-remix.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/ecommerce-storefront-medusa-strapi-remix.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Create an Ecommerce Storefront with Medusa, Strapi, and Remix","date":"2022-11-01","excerpt":"In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build an ecommerce storefront using Medusa, Strapi, and Remix","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/strapi-remix-min-368a33ce.jpg","altText":"Create an Ecommerce Storefront with Medusa, Strapi, and Remix","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-wrfynxqgz.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-wrfynxqgz.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-wrfynxqgz.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Avi","lastName":"Avinav","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"altText":"Person photo","url":"/images/avi-pfp.jpeg"}}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-29bs7fo47.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json"},"type":"Category","name":"Community"},"markdown_content":"\n\u003ccallout icon=\"exclamationCircleSolid\" button-label=\"Go to Docs\" button-url=\"http://docs.medusajs.com\"\u003e\n**Notice**\nMedusa is under active development, so the content of this post may be outdated. Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\n[Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) is an open source composable ecommerce platform that allows developers to create their own customizable and extendable online store. Medusa aims to provide developers with a great experience creating unique ecommerce stores.\n\nCombining Medusa and [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) allows you to create a powerful ecommerce store. Strapi is an open source headless CMS platform that is fully customizable.\n\nWith Medusa, you can perform ecommerce functionalities while using Strapi to control the content displayed on your store.\n\nTo top it off, with [Remix](https://remix.run/) you can create awesome and fast UI. Remix is an open source react framework focused on web standards and modern web app UX. You can also easily fetch data from Medusa and Strapi to your storefront.\n\nIn this tutorial, you will be building an ecommerce storefront with Medusa, Strapi, and Remix.\n\nYou can find the source code for this article [in this repository](https://github.com/AviAvinav/medusa-remix-ecommerce).\n\n![](/images/strapi-demo.gif)\n\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n*   [Node v14 or above](https://docs.medusajs.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment/#nodejs)\n*   [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) is recommended, but you can also follow along with npm.\n*   [Redis](https://docs.medusajs.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment/#redis)\n*   Medusa CLI: To install the CLI, run `yarn global add @medusajs/medusa-cli`.\n\n## Set Up Strapi\n\n### Install the Template\n\n```\nnpx create-strapi-app strapi-medusa --template shahednasser/strapi-medusa-template\n```\n\nThis creates a folder named `strapi-medusa` in your project. Once the installation is complete, the Strapi development server will start on port `localhost:1337`. A new page will also open in your default browser to create a new admin user and log in. After you have logged in, you can access your Strapi Dashboard.\n\n![](/images/1.png)\n\n\n\n### Change Authorization Settings for the User\n\nYour Medusa sever will require the credentials of a Strapi User in order to seed Strapi with mock data. To create a new user, go to Content Manager, then choose User under Collection Types.\n\n![](/images/3-bc000a47.png)\n\n\n\nClick on the Create new entry button at the top right. This opens a new form to enter the user’s details.\n\n![](/images/4-4bcbdf13.png)\n\n\n\nEnter the user’s username, email, and password. Once you’re done, click on the Save button at the top right.\n\nNext, go to Settings → Roles → Authenticated and select all the permissions, and hit save.\n\n![](/images/6.png)\n\n\n\n## Set up Medusa\n\nTo initiate your Medusa server, run the following command:\n\n```\nmedusa new medusa-server --seed\n```\n\nThe `--seed` flag creates an SQLite database and seeds it with some demo data.\n\nChange to the `medusa-server` directory and go to `medusa.config.js`. Change the exported object at the end to enable Redis:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  projectConfig: {\n    redis_url: REDIS_URL,\n    //...\n  }\n  //...\n};\n```\n\nThe default Redis connection string is `redis://localhost:6379` but if you have made changes to it, go to the `.env` file and add the following:\n\n```\nREDIS_URL=\u003cYOUR_REDIS_URL\u003e\n```\n\nWhere `\u003cYOUR_REDIS_URL\u003e` is your connection string.\n\nAdditionally, since the Remix storefront runs on `localhost:3000`, you have to add an environment variable `STORE_CORS` that sets the URL of the storefront.\n\nAdd the following in `.env`:\n\n```\nSTORE_CORS=http://localhost:3000\n```\n\n### Install Strapi Plugin\n\nTo install the Strapi plugin, run the following command in your Medusa server’s directory:\n\n```\nyarn add medusa-plugin-strapi\n```\n\nThen, add the following environment variables:\n\n```\nSTRAPI_USER=\u003cSTRAPI_IDENTIFIER\u003e\nSTRAPI_PASSWORD=\u003cSTRAPI_PASSWORD\u003e\nSTRAPI_PROTOCOL=http\nSTRAPI_URL=\u003cSTRAPI_URL\u003e # Optional\nSTRAPI_PORT=\u003cSTRAPI_PORT\u003e # Optional\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n*   `\u003cSTRAPI_IDENTIFIER\u003e` is either the email address or username of the user you created in the previous step.\n*   `\u003cSTRAPI_PASSWORD\u003e` is the password of the user you created in the previous step.\n*   `\u003cSTRAPI_PROTOCOL\u003e` is the protocol of your Strapi server. Since, you’re using a local Strapi server, set this to `http`. The default value is `https`.\n*   `\u003cSTRAPI_URL\u003e` is the URL of your Strapi server. By default, the URL is `localhost`.\n*   `\u003cSTRAPI_PORT\u003e` is the port the Strapi server runs on. By default, the port is `1337`.\n\nFinally, open `medusa-config.js` and add the following new item to the `plugins` array:\n\n```\nconst plugins = [\n  //...\n  {\n    resolve: `medusa-plugin-strapi`,\n    options: {\n      strapi_medusa_user: process.env.STRAPI_USER,\n      strapi_medusa_password: process.env.STRAPI_PASSWORD,\n      strapi_url: process.env.STRAPI_URL, //optional\n      strapi_port: process.env.STRAPI_PORT, //optional\n      strapi_protocol: process.env.STRAPI_PROTOCOL //optional\n    }\n  }\n];\n```\n\n### Test Integration\n\nMake sure the Strapi server is still running. If not, you can run the following command to run the Strapi server in the directory of the Strapi project:\n\n```\nyarn develop\n```\n\nMake sure your Redis server is up and running as well.\n\nThen, in the directory of your Medusa server, run the following command to start the Medusa server:\n\n```\nyarn start\n```\n\nThis will start your Medusa server on `localhost:9000`. You’ll see that `product.created` events have been triggered along with similar events.\n\n![](/images/medusa-2.png)\n\n\n\nThis will update Strapi with the demo products you seeded.\n\n![](/images/7.png)\n\n\n\n## Add CMS Pages in Strapi\n\nYou will now use Strapi to manage content on your storefront’s homepage. You will be able to control three things from Strapi after this implementation: the hero text that will appear at the top of the storefront; the subheading below the hero text; and the list of products shown on the homepage.\n\nOn your Strapi dashboard, go to Content-Type Builder under Plugins in your Strapi Dashboard. This is where you can define the model/schema for your content.\n\nClick on “Create new single type” under “Single Types”.\n\n![](/images/8\\_\\(Improved\\).png)\n\n\n\nEnter the display name as “Home Page” (if you have used another, you will have to use the appropriate API ID for it later) and hit continue.\n\n![](/images/1%201.png)\n\n\n\nNext, select the component field and give it the display name “Hero Text”, and a category homepage (click create “homepage” under the category). Then, click on configure the component.\n\n![](/images/4%201.png)\n\n\n\nThen give it the name `hero_text` in the next step and click Finish.\n\n![](/images/5-334f8110.png)\n\n\n\nGo to the Hero Text component under Homepage in components and create three text fields named `start_text`, `mid_text` and `end_text`.\n\n![](/images/20.png)\n\n\n\nHere, the three text fields have been added because later on in the article you will give a special underline to the `mid_text` to highlight it.\n\nGo back to the Home Page type under single types and add a relation field to products. The relation should be “homepage has many products”. Give it a field name `products_list`.\n\n![](/images/9.png)\n\n\n\nFinally, add a text field `heading_2`. Save your changes in the homepage content type.\n\nThis is what your homepage content type should look like:\n\n![](/images/22.png)\n\n\n\nNext, go to Settings → Users \u0026 Permissions Plugin → Roles → Public, and enable find permission for the homepage and product type. Hit save.\n\n![](/images/23.png)\n\n\n\nNow, go to the content manager and under the Home Page add your hero text and the products you wish to display under the relations section to the right. Hit save and then publish.\n\n![](/images/24.png)\n\n\n\n## Set up the Remix Storefront\n\nIn this section, you’ll set up the ecommerce storefront with Remix.\n\nRemix has three official pre-built templates for you to use depending on your needs, but you can also start with a basic one or create your own.\n\n### Set up Remix\n\nTo setup a Remix app (do this in a separate directory from `medusa-server` and `strapi-medusa`), run the following command:\n\n```\nnpx create-remix@latest my-storefront\n```\n\nIt will ask you a few questions. Choose `Just the basics`, then choose your preferred hosting platform (you can choose Remix App Server if you are unsure), choose typescript, and no for `npm install` if you wish to use `yarn`.\n\nThen, change to the `my-storefront` directory and install dependencies with yarn:\n\n```\ncd my-storefront\nyarn install\n```\n\n### Configure Tailwind CSS\n\nInstall Tailwind CSS to design the UI element:\n\n```\nyarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer concurrently\n```\n\nRun `npx tailwindcss init` to create your `tailwind.config.js` file. Then, set its content to the following:\n\n```\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\nmodule.exports = {\n  content: [\n    \"./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}\",\n  ],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {},\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n}\n```\n\nAlso, change the scripts in your package.json:\n\n```\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"npm run build:css \u0026\u0026 remix build\",\n    \"build:css\": \"tailwindcss -m -i ./styles/app.css -o app/styles/app.css\",\n    \"dev\": \"concurrently \\\"npm run dev:css\\\" \\\"remix dev\\\"\",\n    \"dev:css\": \"tailwindcss -w -i ./styles/app.css -o app/styles/app.css\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen, create the file `styles/app.css` with the following content:\n\n```\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n```\n\nLastly, add this to your `app/root.tsx` after the list of imports:\n\n```\nimport styles from \"./styles/app.css\"\n\nexport function links() {\n  return [{ rel: \"stylesheet\", href: styles }]\n}\n```\n\nYou can now use Tailwind CSS in your app.\n\n### Connect Storefront to Medusa Server\n\nOnce this is done let’s connect your storefront to your Medusa server.\n\nFirst, you need to install a few packages with the following command:\n\n```\nyarn add medusa-react react-query @medusajs/medusa\n```\n\nThe `medusa-react` library uses [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview) as a solution for server-side state management and lists the library as a peer dependency.\n\nIn order to use the hooks exposed by `medusa-react`, you will need to include the `MedusaProvider` somewhere up in your component tree. The `MedusaProvider` takes a `baseUrl` prop which should point to your Medusa server. Under the hood, `medusa-react` uses the `medusa-js` client library (built on top of `axios`) to interact with your server.\n\nIn addition, because medusa-react is built on top of react-query, you can pass an object representing react-query's [QueryClientProvider](https://react-query.tanstack.com/reference/QueryClientProvider#\\_top) props, which `MedusaProvider` will pass along.\n\nYou also need to wrap your app in a `CartProvider` since that will let you use the cart functionalities provided by Medusa, which you will do later.\n\nCreate a file `app/lib/config.ts`. This file will contain your `medusaClient` which will let you use Medusa’s Javascript client in your app.\n\n```\nimport Medusa from '@medusajs/medusa-js';\nimport { QueryClient } from 'react-query';\n\nconst MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL = 'http://localhost:9000';\n\nconst STRAPI_API_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:1337/api';\n\nconst queryClient = new QueryClient({\n  defaultOptions: {\n    queries: {\n      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,\n      staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24,\n      retry: 1,\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nconst medusaClient = new Medusa({ baseUrl: MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, maxRetries: 3 });\n\nexport { MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, STRAPI_API_URL, queryClient, medusaClient };\n```\n\nNow go to your `app/root.tsx` and import the required packages:\n\n```\nimport { MedusaProvider, CartProvider } from 'medusa-react';\nimport { MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL, queryClient } from './lib/config';\n```\n\nYou can also edit the `meta` here to change your metadata\n\n```\nexport const meta: MetaFunction = () =\u003e ({\n  charset: 'utf-8',\n  title: 'New Remix App',\n  viewport: 'width=device-width,initial-scale=1',\n});\n```\n\nBelow this, you will see the `App` component. In the returned JSX add the `MedusaProvider` and `CartProvider` with some base styles to the `body`:\n\n```\nreturn (\n    \u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n      \u003chead\u003e\n        \u003cMeta /\u003e\n        \u003cLinks /\u003e\n      \u003c/head\u003e\n      \u003cbody className=\"bg-black text-slate-400 overflow-x-hidden justify-center flex\"\u003e\n        \u003cMedusaProvider\n          queryClientProviderProps={{ client: queryClient }}\n          baseUrl={MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL}\n        \u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cCartProvider\u003e\n\t          \u003cOutlet /\u003e\n\t          \u003cScrollRestoration /\u003e\n\t          \u003cScripts /\u003e\n\t          \u003cLiveReload /\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/CartProvider\u003e\n        \u003c/MedusaProvider\u003e\n      \u003c/body\u003e\n    \u003c/html\u003e\n  );\n```\n\n### Display Home Page from Strapi\n\nThe data for your home page is available on the Strapi endpoint: `localhost:1337/api/home-page` (add `?populate=*` to also show the nested products). It returns an object with the `data` \u0026 `meta` arrays. You don't have to care about the `meta`, what you should really care about is `data`, it contains all the content you entered in your Strapi Dashboard.\n\nFirst, create the file `app/types/StrapiResponse.ts` with the following content:\n\n```\n// StrapiResponse.ts\n\nexport type StrapiResponseType = {\n  data: {\n    id: number;\n    attributes: {\n      createdAt: Date;\n      updatedAt: Date;\n      publishedAt: Date;\n      hero_text: {\n        id: number;\n        start_text: string;\n        mid_text: string;\n        end_text: string;\n      };\n      products_list: {\n        data: Array\u003cStrapiProductData\u003e;\n      };\n      heading_2: string;\n    };\n  };\n  meta: {};\n};\n\nexport type StrapiProductData = {\n  id: number;\n  attributes: {\n    medusa_id: string;\n    title: string;\n    subtitle: string | null;\n    description: string;\n    handle: string;\n    is_giftcard: boolean;\n    status: 'draft' | 'proposed' | 'published' | 'rejected';\n    thumbnail: string;\n    discountable: boolean;\n    weight: number;\n    product_length: null;\n    width: null;\n    height: null;\n    hs_code: null;\n    origin_country: null;\n    mid_code: null;\n    material: string | null;\n    createdAt: Date;\n    updatedAt: Date;\n  };\n};\n```\n\nThis is the format in which your data is returned from the Strapi API.\n\nNext, create a utility function to fetch your content from the Strapi API. Create a file `app/models/home.server.ts` with the following content:\n\n```\n// home.server.ts\n\nimport { STRAPI_API_URL } from \"~/lib/config\";\nimport type {\n  StrapiProductData,\n  StrapiResponseType,\n} from \"~/types/StrapiResponse\";\n\nexport const getHomePageData = async () =\u003e {\n  const homePage: StrapiResponseType = await (\n    await fetch(`${STRAPI_API_URL}/home-page?populate=*`)\n  ).json();\n\n  const { data } = homePage;\n\n  const { attributes } = data;\n\n  const heroText = attributes.hero_text;\n  const products = attributes.products_list.data;\n  const smallHeading = attributes.heading_2;\n\n  const homePageData = { heroText, products, smallHeading };\n  return homePageData;\n};\n\nexport type homePageDataType = {\n  heroText: {\n    id: number;\n    start_text: string;\n    mid_text: string;\n    end_text: string;\n  };\n  products: StrapiProductData[];\n  smallHeading: string;\n};\n```\n\nIn the `getHomePageData` function, you should only return the data you need on your home page.\n\nIn the above code sample, you will notice that in the import statement `~` is used, this is because it is the alias set for the `app` directory set in the `tsconfig` by default in Remix, if you wish you can change it at your convenience.\n\nAll files inside the `app/routes` directory will be a route. For example, `app/routes/store.tsx` will contain the `/store` route.\n\nNext, go to `app/routes/index.tsx` and create a loader function:\n\n```\nimport { getHomePageData, homePageDataType } from '~/models/home.server';\n\nexport const loader = async () =\u003e {\n  const homePageData = await getHomePageData();\n\n  return homePageData;\n};\n```\n\nTo use the response you received from the loader function you will use the `useLoaderData` hook from Remix inside the `Index` component:\n\n```\nimport { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react';\n\nexport default function Index() {\n  const { heroText, products, smallHeading } =\n    useLoaderData\u003chomePageDataType\u003e();\n\n\t...\n}\n```\n\nHere, `homePageData` was destructured and brought in using `useLoaderData`, now you can use it on your page.\n\nThen, change the returned JSX to the following:\n\n```\nexport default function Index() {\n\t//...\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv className=\"px-10 sm:px-20 md:px-44 pt-44 max-w-[100rem] flex-grow w-screen\"\u003e\n      {/* Hero Section */}\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n        \u003ch1 className=\"text-[2.5rem] sm:text-5xl lg:text-6xl xl:text-8xl relative font-medium lg:leading-[1.15] xl:leading-[1.2]\"\u003e\n          {heroText.start_text}{' '}\n          {heroText.mid_text.split(' ').map((text) =\u003e (\n            \u003cspan key={text} className=\"text-gray-50\"\u003e\n              \u003cspan className=\"relative\"\u003e\n                {text}\n                \u003cdiv className=\"h-1 bg-emerald-200 w-full absolute bottom-0 left-0 inline-block\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/span\u003e{' '}\n            \u003c/span\u003e\n          ))}\n          {heroText.end_text}\n        \u003c/h1\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\n`heroText.start_text` brings data from the `start_text` text field under the `hero_text` component you made in Strapi. Similarly, `heroText.mid_text` and `heroText.end_text` are from `mid_text` and `end_text` fields from Strapi respectively.\n\nThen `mid_text` has been split so that each word gets a uniform underline in case there are multiple words, you will see it happen a bit later in the homepage UI.\n\nTo display your products, create the file `app/components/productCard.tsx` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { Link } from '@remix-run/react';\n\ninterface ProductCardType {\n  image: string;\n  title: string;\n  handle: string;\n}\n\nexport default function ProductCard({ image, title, handle }: ProductCardType) {\n  return (\n    \u003cLink to={`/products/${handle}`}\u003e\n      \u003cdiv className=\"flex flex-col space-y-1 p-2 hover:bg-slate-400 hover:bg-opacity-25 cursor-pointer active:scale-95 transition ease-in-out duration-75\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg src={image} alt=\"\" /\u003e\n        \u003ch3 className=\"pt-2 text-white text-xl\"\u003e{title}\u003c/h3\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/Link\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThe `Link` comes from Remix and will help you redirect to the products page. The handle prop which is available in Medusa products will be used as a slug.\n\nNow getting back to your `app/routes/index.tsx`, you will map your Strapi response (products) to the page.\n\nDo this just below your hero section:\n\n```\nimport ProductCard from '~/components/productCard';\n\nexport default function Index() {\n\t...\n\n\treturn (\n\t\t\u003cdiv className=\"px-10 sm:px-20 md:px-44 pt-44 max-w-[100rem] flex-grow w-screen\"\u003e\n\t\t\t...\n\t\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv className=\"flex flex-col items-center pt-40 pb-44\"\u003e\n\t\t    \u003ch2 className=\"text-2xl sm:text-3xl lg:text-4xl pb-10 text-white\"\u003e\n\t\t      {smallHeading}\n\t      \u003c/h2\u003e\n\t      \u003cdiv className=\"grid grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-4 gap-x-6\"\u003e\n\t\t      {products.map(({ attributes }) =\u003e (\n\t\t        \u003cProductCard\n\t\t          key={attributes.medusa_id}\n\t            image={attributes.thumbnail}\n\t            handle={attributes.handle}\n\t            title={attributes.title}\n\t          /\u003e\n\t        ))}\n\t      \u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t  \u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n)\n```\n\n### Test Homepage\n\nTo test out your homepage, start your Remix development server with `yarn dev` (make sure that your Medusa and Strapi servers are already running).\n\nYour app is ready at `localhost:3000` and it will look like the following:\n\n![](/images/8.png)\n\n\n\n### Implement Add to Cart Functionality with Medusa\n\nTo add your products to the cart, you first need to associate a cart with the customer. To do this, you can create a wrapper around your app that checks if a cart has already been initialized or need to be created, and does the needful.\n\nCreate the file `app/components/outletContainer.tsx` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { useCart } from 'medusa-react';\nimport { ReactNode, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nimport { medusaClient } from '~/lib/config';\n\ninterface OutletContainerType {\n  children: ReactNode;\n}\n\nexport default function OutletContainer({ children }: OutletContainerType) {\n  const { setCart } = useCart();\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    const localCartId = localStorage.getItem('cart_id');\n    localCartId\n      ? medusaClient.carts.retrieve(localCartId).then(({ cart }) =\u003e {\n          setCart(cart);\n        })\n      : medusaClient.carts.create().then(({ cart }) =\u003e {\n          localStorage.setItem('cart_id', cart.id);\n          setCart(cart);\n        });\n  }, []);\n\n  return \u003cdiv\u003e{children}\u003c/div\u003e;\n}\n```\n\nYou are using `medusa-react`'s `useCart` hook, `setCart` will set your cart globally. You can then use it anywhere in your app. The `outletContainer` will also save cart localStorage so that the added items persist even when the user returns.\n\nYou will also need to show toast notifications when a product is added to the cart. Install `react-hot-toast` to do this:\n\n```\nyarn add react-hot-toast\n```\n\nNow, go back to your `app/root.tsx` and wrap your `\u003cOutlet /\u003e` with `OutletContainer`. Also, add `\u003cToaster /\u003e` from `react-hot-toast` that will let you show notifications:\n\n```\nimport OutletContainer from './components/outletContainer';\nimport { Toaster } from 'react-hot-toast';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    ...\n\t    \u003cCartProvider\u003e\n\t      \u003cOutletContainer\u003e\n\t        \u003cOutlet /\u003e\n        \u003c/OutletContainer\u003e\n        ...\n\t\t\t\t\u003cToaster /\u003e\n      \u003c/CartProvider\u003e\n\t  ...\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Create Product Page\n\nIn this section, you’ll create a product page. When you are deploying to production, you can’t make a separate page for each of your products, so you will create a dynamic page that will run according to your product’s `handle`. In Remix you will name your dynamic pages as `$slug.tsx`.\n\nYou will need to get the `handle` from the URL of your page, you can do that with a loader function but it’s much simpler to use `useParams` hook.\n\nCreate the file `app/routes/products/$slug.tsx` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { useParams } from '@remix-run/react';\nimport { useCart, useCreateLineItem, useProducts } from 'medusa-react';\n\nexport default function ProductSlug() {\n  const { slug } = useParams();\n}\n```\n\n`slug` is getting your page’s slug from your URL, for example, in `localhost:3000/products/sweatshirt` the slug is `sweatshirt` (remember you passed in the `handle` in your `ProductCard` component).\n\nNext, fetch your product from Medusa using the `useProducts` hook and add it to the UI:\n\n```\nexport default function ProductSlug() {\n  ...\n\n  const { products } = useProducts(\n    {\n      handle: slug,\n    },\n    {}\n  );\n\nif (!products) {\n    return \u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e; // you can use skeleton loader here instead.\n  }\n\nconst product = products[0];\n\nreturn (\n  \u003cdiv className=\"flex flex-col items-center lg:justify-between lg:flex-row px-10 sm:px-20 md:px-44 pt-44 max-w-[100rem] flex-grow w-screen\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src={product.thumbnail!} className=\"h-96 w-auto\" /\u003e\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003ch1 className=\"text-4xl pb-10 text-white\"\u003e{product.title}\u003c/h1\u003e\n      \u003cp className=\"w-72\"\u003e{product.description}\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n );\n}\n```\n\nHere, the `useProducts` hook was used and passed the slug. While the product is being loaded you show an empty div (you can use a skeleton loader instead).\n\nFinally, you use the first item returned by the `useProducts` hook which is the product that has the handle in the page’s URL.\n\nPlease notice that the title and description are used here from the Medusa server since the Strapi plugin supports two-way sync. So, whenever you make changes to the products in Strapi, they’re reflected on the Medusa server as well. You can alternatively show the CMS data for the product from Strapi instead.\n\nYou also need to show the prices for your customers according to their region. To do this, create the file `app/lib/formatPrice.ts`:\n\n```\nimport { formatVariantPrice } from 'medusa-react';\nimport type { Cart } from \"medusa-react/dist/types\";\nimport type { ProductVariant } from '@medusajs/medusa';\n\nexport const formatPrice = (variant: ProductVariant, cart: Cart) =\u003e {\n  if (cart)\n    return formatVariantPrice({\n      variant: variant,\n      region: cart.region,\n    });\n};\n```\n\nYou use the `formatVariantPrice` function here from `medusa-react`. This formats the price according to your user’s region and the product variant selected.\n\nThen, use it in `app/routes/products/$slug.tsx`:\n\n```\nimport { formatPrice } from '~/lib/formatPrice';\n\nexport default ProductSlug() {\n\t...\n\n\tconst { cart } = useCart();\n\n\treturn (\n\t\t\u003cdiv className=\"flex flex-col items-center lg:justify-between lg:flex-row px-10 pb-44 sm:px-20 md:px-44 pt-44 max-w-[100rem] flex-grow w-screen\"\u003e\n      \u003cimg src={product.thumbnail!} className=\"h-96 w-auto\" /\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n        \u003ch1 className=\"text-4xl pt-5 lg:pt-0 pb-5 lg:pb-10 text-white\"\u003e\n          {product.title}\n        \u003c/h1\u003e\n        \u003cp className=\"w-72\"\u003e{product.description}\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp className=\"text-xl text-white pt-5\"\u003e\n          {formatPrice(product.variants[0], cart)}\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\t)\n}\n```\n\nNext, create a function to add to the cart and push notifications.\n\n```\nimport toast from 'react-hot-toast';\n\nexport default function ProductSlug() {\n\t...\t\n\n  const { mutate } = useCreateLineItem(cart?.id!);\n\n  const addItem = () =\u003e {\n    mutate(\n      {\n        variant_id: products?.slice(0, 1)[0].variants[0].id!,\n        quantity: 1,\n      },\n      {\n        onSuccess: () =\u003e {\n          toast('Added to Cart!');\n        },\n      }\n    );\n  };\n\n\t...\n}\n```\n\nThe `useCreateLineItem` hook lets you add items. It requires a cart ID. The `addItem` function will add the product to the cart and then show a toast notification.\n\nAdd the button that will run this function on click in the returned JSX:\n\n```\nexport default function ProductSlug() {\n  ...\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv className=\"flex flex-col items-center lg:justify-between lg:flex-row px-10 sm:px-20 md:px-44 pt-44 max-w-[100rem] flex-grow w-screen\"\u003e\n      \u003cimg src={product.thumbnail!} className=\"h-96 w-auto\" /\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n        \u003ch1 className=\"text-4xl pb-10 text-white\"\u003e{product.title}\u003c/h1\u003e\n        \u003cp className=\"w-72\"\u003e{product.description}\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003cp className=\"text-xl text-white pt-5\"\u003e\n          {formatPrice(product.variants[0])}\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cbutton\n          className=\"p-5 rounded-md w-full bg-slate-400 bg-opacity-25 mt-10 cursor-pointer active:scale-95 transition ease-in-out duration-75\"\n          onClick={() =\u003e addItem()}\n        \u003e\n          Add item\n        \u003c/button\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThe last step is to add a navigation bar to make it easy to navigate to the cart.\n\nCreate the file `app/components/topNavigator.tsx` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { Link } from '@remix-run/react';\n\nexport default function TopNavigator() {\n  return (\n    \u003cnav className=\"flex w-screen fixed top-0 right-0 left-0 items-center py-4 flex-row justify-between px-10 sm:px-20 md:px-44 z-10 bg-black\"\u003e\n      \u003cLink to=\"/\" className=\"text-xl\"\u003e\n        MRS\n      \u003c/Link\u003e\n      \u003cLink to=\"/cart\"\u003eCart\u003c/Link\u003e\n    \u003c/nav\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\nAdd the `TopNavigator` component to your `root.tsx` so it appears on all pages. Add it just above the `Outlet`:\n\n```\nimport TopNavigator from './components/topNavigator';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    ...\n\t    \u003cCartProvider\u003e\n\t      \u003cOutletContainer\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cTopNavigator /\u003e\n\t        \u003cOutlet /\u003e\n        \u003c/OutletContainer\u003e\n        ...\n      \u003c/CartProvider\u003e\n\t  ...\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Test Product Page\n\nTo test out your product page, restart your Remix server (make sure Strapi and Medusa servers are already running).\n\nClick on any of the products on your homepage and you will be able to see the details.\n\n![](/images/18.png)\n\n\n\n### Create Cart Page\n\nNow, you will create your very final cart page.\n\nCreate the file `app/routes/cart.tsx` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport { medusaClient } from \"~/lib/config\";\n\nimport type { Cart as CartType } from \"medusa-react/dist/types\";\n\nexport default function Cart() {\n  const [cart, setCart] = useState\u003cCartType\u003e();\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    medusaClient.carts\n      .retrieve(localStorage.getItem(\"cart_id\")!)\n      .then(({ cart }) =\u003e {\n        setCart(cart);\n      });\n  }, [cart]);\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv className=\"px-10 sm:px-20 md:px-44 pt-44 max-w-[100rem] flex-grow w-screen\"\u003e\n      {cart?.items.map((variant) =\u003e (\n        \u003cdiv\n          key={variant.id}\n          className=\"flex flex-col xl:flex-row h-64 my-10 space-x-8 space-y-4 items-center\"\n        \u003e\n          \u003cimg className=\"h-full\" src={variant.thumbnail!} /\u003e\n          \u003cdiv\u003e\n            \u003ch3 className=\"pt-2 text-white text-xl\"\u003e{variant.title}\u003c/h3\u003e\n            \u003cp className=\"text-slate-400\"\u003e{variant.quantity}\u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n      ))}\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\n`cart.items` is an array of all the items in the customer’s cart. You display each item with its thumbnail, title, and quantity.\n\n### Test Cart Page\n\nRestart your Remix server (make sure Strapi and Medusa servers are already running). When you add an item to the cart it will show on the cart page.\n\n![](/images/16.png)\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere’s still much more that can be done to improve your storefront such as:\n\n*   Improve the UI\n*   [Improve Cart](https://docs.medusajs.com/guides/carts-in-medusa/) page to add functionalities such as removing or updating items.\n*   [Implement Checkout Flow](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/storefront/how-to-implement-checkout-flow/)\n*   Integrate [Stripe Plugin](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/stripe) for payment.\n*   [Install Medusa Admin](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/quickstart) to manage orders, products, and much more.\n*   Check out [Medusa’s Storefront API](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store/) Reference to learn what more you can do in your storefront.\n\n\u003e Should you have any issues or questions related to Medusa, then feel free to reach out to the Medusa team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp).\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/hackathon-winners.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/hackathon-winners.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/hackathon-winners.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Medusa Hackathon 2022: This Year Winners Announcement","date":"2022-10-27","excerpt":"Get ready to meet the winners of our Medusa Hackathon,  including the $1,500 grand prize victor and other exciting prizes.","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/hackathon-banner-large-purple-live (7).jpg","altText":"Hackathon Winners","caption":"Hackathon Winners"},"mainPost":true,"seo_description":null,"seo_keywords":"Hackathon, open source","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-osliwntg2.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-osliwntg2.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-osliwntg2.json"},"firstName":"Nicklas ","lastName":"Gellner","image":{"url":"/images/Nick.png","altText":"Nicklas Gellner"},"type":"Person"}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-29bs7fo47.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json"},"type":"Category","name":"Community"},"markdown_content":"Our first Medusa Hackathon has come to an end and the outcome has been incredible. The amount of solutions far exceeded our expectations with +200 participants across 120 submissions. Among these, we saw some extraordinary cool solutions.\n\nThanks a lot to all the participants that took part. Also a big shout out to the many community members that took it upon themselves to help new members get a good first experience with Medusa.\n\nWith many great submissions, it proved difficult to select only 4 winners - 1 overall winner \u0026 3 category winners. In the end, after lengthy deliberation, we have found our winners.\n\nYou can find all submissions [here](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/discussions/2280) and an overview of our competition guidelines [here](https://medusajs.com/blog/medusa-hackathon).\n\n## Winner: Best Overall\n\n[**Payment integration to Paystack**](https://github.com/a11rew/medusa-payment-paystack)\n\nBy [**Andrew Glago**](https://twitter.com/a11rew) \u0026 [**Femi Akinyemi**](https://twitter.com/akinyemi_t)\n\n![](/images/Group%20107%20\\(1\\)%20\\(1\\).png)\n\nAndrew and Femi built a payment provider plugin integrating Paystack with Medusa. The plugin enables African businesses to accept payments in local and foreign currencies and is built to support all of Paystack’s checkout flows (Popup, Redirect, API). Andrew and Femi not only built a sophisticated payment plugin but also included a frontend implementation using our NextJS starter template and added a 5-minute demo taking you through the complete setup and a demo of the full flow.\n\nThe main criteria for the Best Overall Project were usefulness and project completeness. Andrew and Femi excelled on these parameters, placing them at the top of the podium.\n\n## Winner: Most technically impressive\n\n[**Webhooks as a notification service**](https://github.com/AnishDe12020/medusa-plugin-webhooks)\n\nBy [**Anish De**](https://twitter.com/AnishDe12020)\n\n![](/images/Untitled%20\\(7\\).png)\n\nAnish built a plugin allowing developers to send core events to webhooks easily. With the plugin, you can effectively centralize your usage of webhooks in one single place instead of having to install separate plugins for each of those use cases e.g., Discord, Slack, etc.\n\nWe are mind-blown by the fact that Anish, at only 15 years old, managed to know his way around our codebase, build a sophisticated plugin, and generally is engaged in the open-source developer community.\n\n## Winner: Best shop\n\n[**Habesha clothing store**](https://github.com/earthcomfy/shop-habesha)\n\nBy: [**Hana**](https://twitter.com/earthcomfy)\n\n![](/images/Untitled%20\\(9\\)-ca78f5aa.png)\n\nHana built a beautiful clothing store for the brand Habesha on top of our NextJS starter template. What sets this store apart from the rest is the addition of elements that improve the overall commerce experience, including Algolia for search and a quick view functionality for products.\n\n## Winner: Best design\n\n![](/images/Burger%20Hat.png)\n\n[**Burger Hat store**](https://github.com/realanupreet/burgerHat)\n\nBy [**Anupreet Singh**](https://twitter.com/real_anupreet)\n\nAnupreet used our NextJS starter to build a super good-looking storefront for a burger restaurant. The starter was heavily customized to fit the concept and theme of the burger restaurant, and the thoroughness and consistency of the modifications are indeed impressive!\n\n## Runner up list\n\nHere's a list of Projects that were runner-ups as competition and category winners:\n\n*   [**Maxmind plugin**](https://github.com/g33kdev/medusa-plugin-ip-lookup-maxmind) by [@stnguyen90](https://github.com/stnguyen90) (IP lookup)\n*   [**3D Product Previewer**](https://github.com/manojvirat457/Medusa-3D-Swag-Store) by [@MrKrishnaAgarwal](https://github.com/MrKrishnaAgarwal), [@TamilPrakash-S](https://github.com/TamilPrakash-S) \u0026 [@manojvirat457](https://github.com/manojvirat457) (Store)\n*   [**Reepay integration**](https://github.com/Agilo/medusa-payment-reepay) by [@josipmatichr](https://github.com/josipmatichr), [@anteprimorac](https://github.com/anteprimorac) \u0026 [@marijapolovic](https://github.com/marijapolovic) (Payment)\n*   [**Cashfree plugin**](https://github.com/Ambareen09/medusa-store) by [@Azanul](https://twitter.com/AzanulZ) \u0026 [@AzamAmbareen](https://twitter.com/AzamAmbareen) (Payment)\n*   [**Paytm plugin**](https://github.com/saurabh73/medusa-payment-paytm) by [GyaniRoman23](https://github.com/gyaniroman23) \u0026 [saurabh73](https://github.com/saurabh73) (Payment)\n*   [**Wompi plugin**](https://github.com/Cristian-David-Github/medusa-payment-wompi-col) by [@Cristian-David-Github](https://github.com/Cristian-David-Github) (Payment)\n*   [**Billplz plugin**](https://github.com/ibnumalik/medusa-payment-billplz) by [@ibnumalik](https://github.com/ibnumalik) (Payment)\n*   [**PNPM Monorepo**](https://github.com/dalenguyen/medusa-monorepo) by [@dale_nguyen](https://twitter.com/dale_nguyen) (PNPM)\n*   [**Go.lang SDK**](https://github.com/harshmangalam/medusa-sdk-golang) by [@HarshMangalam6](https://twitter.com/HarshMangalam6) (SDK)\n*   [**Flutter Package**](https://github.com/parth-asodariya/medusa_flutter) by [karanjoshi, ](https://github.com/karanjoshi)[keval-makadiya](https://github.com/keval-makadiya), [Pankti910](https://github.com/Pankti910), [parth-asodariya](https://github.com/parth-asodariya) \u0026 [Snehal-Singh174](https://github.com/Snehal-Singh174)(Flutter Package)\n*   [**Discord integration**](https://github.com/superstashed/medusa-stonkers) by [@stefa-n](https://github.com/stefa-n), [@Feely3007](https://github.com/Feely3007) \u0026 [@penktastal](https://github.com/penktastal) (Social)\n\n## Prizes\n\nFor all participants and winners, we will get back to you via Discord to coordinate the shipping of prizes, participation certificates, and GitHub sponsorships.

Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\nMedusa is currently hosting a [Hackathon](https://medusajs.com/blog/medusa-hackathon-warming-up-for-hacktoberfest/) where developers can create amazing projects with Medusa and win prizes and swag. An example of a Hackathon project is building an ecommerce app with React Native, which is covered in this article.\n\nThis is part 2 of **Creating a React Native ecommerce App with Medusa** series. In the previous article, you learned how to set up the Medusa server and admin, and how to create a basic ecommerce app.\n\nIn this part, you will learn how to implement cart and checkout functionalities. You can also find the source code of the React Native app on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/suhailkakar/react-native-medusajs)**.**\n\n![](/images/react-native-2.gif)\n\n## **Prerequisites**\n\n*   You need a Stripe account, you can signup [here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).\n\n### Clone the Starter Code\n\nIf you skipped part 1, you can clone the code from GitHub. To do that, simply run the below command:\n\n```\ngit clone -b part-1 https://github.com/suhailkakar/react-native-medusajs \n```\n\nOnce you have cloned the repository, move to the newly-created directory, `react-native-medusajs`, by running `cd react-native-medusajs`. Run the below command to install the node modules:\n\n```\nyarn install\n```\n\nThe above command will install the necessary packages and dependencies from the NPM registry.\n\nAfter the dependencies are installed successfully, run `expo start` to start the application. You can either scan the QR code using your device or run the app on an Android/iOS simulator.  You should see a similar screen once the app is opened on your device/emulator.\n\n\u003e Make sure that the Medusa server is running as well.\n\n![](/images/Untitled-650203c1.png)\n\nYou might need to modify the URL in `constants/urls.js` if you can't see the products. You can update the base URL to the IP address where the backend server is running.\n\n## Creating the Cart\n\nThe first step is to implement the cart functionality. Install `async-storage` to save the cart id in the device’s local storage. Run the below command to install `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` in the project:\n\n```\nexpo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage\n```\n\nOnce the package is installed, open the project in any code editor and paste the below code into `App.js` before the return function:\n\n```\nconst getCartId = () =\u003e {\n    axios.post(`${baseURL}/store/carts`).then((res) =\u003e {\n      AsyncStorage.setItem(\"cart_id\", res.data.cart.id);\n    });\n  };\n```\n\nIn the above code, you created a function named `getCartId` and inside of that function, you are querying the backend API to get a cart id using Axios and then saving it in the device’s local storage using `async-storage`.\n\n\u003e Make sure to import async-storage, useEffect, Axios and baseURL in the `App.js` file:\n\n```\nimport axios from \"axios\";\nimport baseURL from \"./constants/url\";\nimport { useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport AsyncStorage from \"@react-native-async-storage/async-storage\";\n```\n\nThe above function (`getCartId`) will not run since you didn’t call it yet. However, you want to run this function only if there is no cart id saved in the device’s local storage.\n\nNow, write another function to check if there’s already a cart id in the device’s local storage. If there isn’t, the function should call `getCartId`. Lastly, call the `checkCartId` inside of useEffect:\n\n```\n\n// Check cart_id \n  const checkCartId = async () =\u003e {\n    const cartId = await AsyncStorage.getItem(\"cart_id\");\n    if (!cartId) {\n      getCartId();\n    }\n  };\n\nuseEffect(() =\u003e {\n    checkCartId();\n}, []);\n```\n\n### Adding Products to the Cart\n\nFirst, let’s update the button component and add a prop to update the button layout based on the size provided. You can replace the code inside `components/Button.js` with the code below:\n\n```\nimport { View, Text, StyleSheet } from \"react-native\";\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { widthToDp } from \"rn-responsive-screen\";\n\nexport default function Button({ title, onPress, style, textSize, large }) {\n  return (\n    \u003cView style={[styles.container, style, large \u0026\u0026 styles.large]}\u003e\n      \u003cText\n        style={[\n          styles.text,\n          { fontSize: textSize ? textSize : widthToDp(3.5) },\n          ,\n        ]}\n        onPress={onPress}\n      \u003e\n        {title}\n      \u003c/Text\u003e\n    \u003c/View\u003e\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    backgroundColor: \"#C37AFF\",\n    padding: 5,\n    width: widthToDp(20),\n    alignItems: \"center\",\n    justifyContent: \"center\",\n    borderRadius: 59,\n  },\n  large: {\n    width: \"100%\",\n    marginTop: 10,\n    height: widthToDp(12),\n  },\n  text: {\n    color: \"#fff\",\n    fontWeight: \"bold\",\n  },\n});\n```\n\nRecall that by the end of Part 1, you have created a component at `components/ProductInfo/MetaInfo.js` to display the description, size, and other information about the product. Go ahead and add a button component after the description:\n\n```\n\u003cButton title=\"Add to Cart\" onPress={addToCart} large={true} /\u003e\n```\n\nAlso, make sure to import the button component from `components/Button`:\n\n```\nimport Button from \"../Button\";\n```\n\nAs you can see, you are calling `addToCart` function when the user presses the button, so declare that function.\n\nOn top of `MetaInfo.js` component before return, declare a new function named addToCart and add the below code inside of it:\n\n```\nconst addToCart = async () =\u003e {\n    const cartId = await AsyncStorage.getItem(\"cart_id\");\n    axios\n      .post(`${baseURL}/store/carts/${cartId}/line-items`, {\n        variant_id: product.variants[0].id,\n        quantity: 1,\n      })\n      .then(({ data }) =\u003e {\n        alert(`Item ${product.title} added to cart`);\n      })\n      .catch((err) =\u003e {\n        console.log(err);\n      });\n  };\n```\n\nIn the above code, first, you are fetching the `cart_id` from async storage and then posting the product’s first variant with 1 quantity to the cart API. Next, you are navigating users to the cart screen.\n\nYou also need to import AsyncStorage, axios and baseURL in the `MetaInfo.js` file:\n\n```\nimport axios from \"axios\";\nimport baseURL from \"../../constants/url\";\nimport AsyncStorage from \"@react-native-async-storage/async-storage\";\n```\n\n### Cart Screen\n\nThis is the screen where the user will see the products they added to the cart. Create a new file named `screens/Cart.js` and use it to render a simple \\`\\` component for now:\n\n```\nimport { View, Text } from \"react-native\";\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nexport default function Cart() {\n  return (\n    \u003cView\u003e\n      \u003cText\u003eCart Screen\u003c/Text\u003e\n    \u003c/View\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThen, import the cart screen at the top of \\`\\`:\n\n```\nimport Cart from \"./screens/Cart\";\n```\n\nAdd a new `component below the existing` component in the returned JSX:\n\n```\n\u003cScene key=\"cart\" component={Cart} hideNavBar /\u003e\n```\n\nIn the \\`\\` directory, create a new file named `CartItem.js`  and add the following content:\n\n```\nimport { View, Text, StyleSheet, Image } from \"react-native\";\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { heightToDp, width, widthToDp } from \"rn-responsive-screen\";\n\nexport default function CartItem({ product }) {\n  return (\n    \u003cView style={styles.container}\u003e\n      \u003cImage source={{ uri: product.thumbnail }} style={styles.image} /\u003e\n      \u003cView style={styles.info}\u003e\n        \u003cView\u003e\n          \u003cText style={styles.title}\u003e{product.title}\u003c/Text\u003e\n          \u003cText style={styles.description}\u003e\n            {product.description} • ${product.unit_price / 100}\n          \u003c/Text\u003e\n        \u003c/View\u003e\n        \u003cView style={styles.footer}\u003e\n          \u003cText style={styles.price}\u003e${product.total / 100}\u003c/Text\u003e\n          \u003cText style={styles.quantity}\u003ex{product.quantity}\u003c/Text\u003e\n        \u003c/View\u003e\n      \u003c/View\u003e\n    \u003c/View\u003e\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    marginTop: 20,\n    flexDirection: \"row\",\n    borderBottomWidth: 1,\n    paddingBottom: 10,\n    borderColor: \"#e6e6e6\",\n    width: widthToDp(\"90%\"),\n  },\n  image: {\n    width: widthToDp(30),\n    height: heightToDp(30),\n    borderRadius: 10,\n  },\n  title: {\n    fontSize: widthToDp(4),\n    fontWeight: \"bold\",\n  },\n  footer: {\n    flexDirection: \"row\",\n    justifyContent: \"space-between\",\n  },\n  info: {\n    marginLeft: widthToDp(3),\n    flexDirection: \"column\",\n    justifyContent: \"space-between\",\n    marginVertical: heightToDp(2),\n    width: widthToDp(50),\n  },\n  description: {\n    fontSize: widthToDp(3.5),\n    color: \"#8e8e93\",\n    marginTop: heightToDp(2),\n  },\n\n  price: {\n    fontSize: widthToDp(4),\n  },\n  quantity: {\n    fontSize: widthToDp(4),\n  },\n});\n```\n\nThe above code is a simple React Native cart component which will be rendered on the cart screen. You are passing the props to the component from the parent component.  This is the component that will represent an item in the cart.\n\nNext, in the `screens/Cart.js` file, add the below function and useState before the return statement to fetch the products from the cart API and store them in the state:\n\n```\nconst [cart, setCart] = useState([]);\n\n  const fetchCart = async () =\u003e {\n    // Get the cart id from the device storage\n    const cartId = await AsyncStorage.getItem(\"cart_id\");\n    // Fetch the products from the cart API using the cart id\n    axios.get(`${baseURL}/store/carts/${cartId}`).then(({ data }) =\u003e {\n      // Set the cart state to the products in the cart\n      setCart(data.cart);\n    });\n  };\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n\t\t// Calling the fetchCart function when the component mounts\n    fetchCart();\n  }, []);\n```\n\nIn the above code, you are getting the cart id from the device storage,  fetching the products from the cart API and saving the data to the state. Next, you are calling the function inside of useEffect. Replace the import at the top of the `screens/Cart.js` file with the code below:\n\n```\nimport { View, Text, StyleSheet } from \"react-native\";\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from \"react\";\nimport Header from \"../components/Header\";\nimport axios from \"axios\";\nimport baseURL from \"../constants/url\";\nimport CartItem from \"../components/CartItem\";\nimport { ScrollView } from \"react-native-gesture-handler\";\nimport { SafeAreaView } from \"react-native-safe-area-context\";\nimport { width, widthToDp } from \"rn-responsive-screen\";\nimport Button from \"../components/Button\";\nimport { Actions } from \"react-native-router-flux\";\nimport AsyncStorage from \"@react-native-async-storage/async-storage\";\n```\n\nNow that you have fetched the data and saved it to the state, it's time to render the products on the cart screen. Replace everything below useEffect function with the below code:\n\n```\nreturn (\n    // SafeAreaView is used to avoid the notch on the phone\n    \u003cSafeAreaView style={[styles.container]}\u003e\n      {/* SchrollView is used in order to scroll the content */}\n      \u003cScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.container}\u003e\n        {/* Using the reusable header component */}\n        \u003cHeader title=\"My Cart\" /\u003e\n       \n        {/* Mapping the products into the Cart component */}\n        {cart?.items?.map((product) =\u003e (\n          \u003cCartItem product={product} /\u003e\n        ))}\n      \u003c/ScrollView\u003e\n      {/* Creating a seperate view to show the total amount and checkout button */}\n      \u003cView\u003e\n        \u003cView style={styles.row}\u003e\n          \u003cText style={styles.cartTotalText}\u003eItems\u003c/Text\u003e\n\n          {/* Showing Cart Total */}\n          \u003cText\n            style={[\n              styles.cartTotalText,\n              {\n                color: \"#4C4C4C\",\n              },\n            ]}\n          \u003e\n            {/* Dividing the total by 100 because Medusa doesn't store numbers in decimal */}\n            ${cart?.total / 100}\n          \u003c/Text\u003e\n        \u003c/View\u003e\n        \u003cView style={styles.row}\u003e\n          {/* Showing the discount (if any) */}\n          \u003cText style={styles.cartTotalText}\u003eDiscount\u003c/Text\u003e\n          \u003cText\n            style={[\n              styles.cartTotalText,\n              {\n                color: \"#4C4C4C\",\n              },\n            ]}\n          \u003e\n            - ${cart?.discount_total / 100}\n          \u003c/Text\u003e\n        \u003c/View\u003e\n        \u003cView style={[styles.row, styles.total]}\u003e\n          \u003cText style={styles.cartTotalText}\u003eTotal\u003c/Text\u003e\n          \u003cText\n            style={[\n              styles.cartTotalText,\n              {\n                color: \"#4C4C4C\",\n              },\n            ]}\n          \u003e\n            {/* Calculating the total */}$\n            {cart?.total / 100 - cart?.discount_total / 100}\n          \u003c/Text\u003e\n        \u003c/View\u003e\n        \u003cView\u003e\n          {/* A button to navigate to checkout screen */}\n          \u003cButton\n            large={true}\n            onPress={() =\u003e {\n              Actions.checkout({\n                cart,\n              });\n            }}\n            title={cart?.items?.length \u003e 0 ? \"Checkout\" : \"Empty Cart\"}\n          /\u003e\n        \u003c/View\u003e\n      \u003c/View\u003e\n    \u003c/SafeAreaView\u003e\n  );\n}\n\n// Styles....\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    backgroundColor: \"#fff\",\n    alignItems: \"center\",\n  },\n  row: {\n    flexDirection: \"row\",\n    justifyContent: \"space-between\",\n    width: widthToDp(90),\n    marginTop: 10,\n  },\n  total: {\n    borderTopWidth: 1,\n    paddingTop: 10,\n    borderTopColor: \"#E5E5E5\",\n    marginBottom: 10,\n  },\n  cartTotalText: {\n    fontSize: widthToDp(4.5),\n    color: \"#989899\",\n  },\n});\n```\n\nNext, you’ll add a basic and simple button component in the `screens/Products.js` in order to navigate to the cart screen.\n\nAdd the below code after the `ScrollView` component in the `screens/Products.js` screen:\n\n```\n\u003cView style={styles.addToCart}\u003e\n        \u003cFeather\n          name=\"shopping-cart\"\n          size={24}\n          color=\"white\"\n          onPress={() =\u003e Actions.cart()}\n        /\u003e\n      \u003c/View\u003e\n```\n\nMake sure to also add the style object inside `StyleSheet.create` function:\n\n```\naddToCart: {\n    position: \"absolute\",\n    bottom: 30,\n    right: 10,\n    backgroundColor: \"#C37AFF\",\n    width: widthToDp(12),\n    height: widthToDp(12),\n    borderRadius: widthToDp(10),\n    alignItems: \"center\",\n    padding: widthToDp(2),\n    justifyContent: \"center\",\n  },\n```\n\nYou also need to import the feather icons from `@expo/vector-icons` at the top of the file:\n\n```\nimport { Feather } from \"@expo/vector-icons\";\n```\n\n### Test Cart Screen\n\nThe cart screen is ready. Make sure that the Medusa server is running, then re-run your React Native app.\n\nTry adding a few products into the cart, and then view the cart. Your cart screen should look like this:\n\n![](/images/Untitled%201-b2ef4b7e.png)\n\n## Checkout \u0026 Payment\n\nNow that we have completed the cart flow, it is time for checkout flow.\n\n### **Configure the Stripe Plugin**\n\nNavigate to the Medusa server directory and install the Stripe plugin by running the command below:\n\n```\nnpm install medusa-payment-stripe\n```\n\nAdd the following code at the end of the plugins array in the `medusa-config.js`.\n\n```\nconst plugins = [\n  ...,\n  {\n    resolve: `medusa-payment-stripe`,\n    options: {\n      api_key: process.env.STRIPE_API_KEY,\n    },\n  },\n];\n```\n\nFor this tutorial, I used Stripe to handle payments. Navigate to the Stripe dashboard and make sure to turn on the toggle button of **Test Mode** on the top right. Click the developers button beside the Test Mode. On the left, choose **API key** and you can find the **Publishable key** and **Secret key**. Copy the two keys, as you will need them later.\n\n![](/images/Untitled%202.png)\n\nIn the `.env` file, paste your secret key where is it written `STRIPE_API_KEY`.\n\n## Enable Stripe as a Payment Provider\n\nMake sure that the Medusa server and admin panel is running. Now, open the Medusa admin panel and choose **Settings** from the Sidebar. Then, choose **Regions**.\n\nThen, choose the regions you want to add Stripe as a payment provider. In the right-side settings, click on the three dots icon and choose “Edit Region Details”.\n\nIn the new window that opens, choose Stripe in the payment providers field. Once you’re done, click the **save and close** button.\n\n### Checkout Screen\n\nComing back to the React Native app, create a new file `screens/Checkout.js` and add a simple Text component to it:\n\n```\nimport { View, Text } from \"react-native\";\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nexport default function Checkout() {\n  return (\n    \u003cView\u003e\n      \u003cText\u003eCheckout\u003c/Text\u003e\n    \u003c/View\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThen, import the checkout screen at the top of \\`\\`:\n\n```\nimport Checkout from \"./screens/Checkout\";\n```\n\nAdd a new `component below the existing` components in the returned JSX:\n\n```\n\u003cScene key=\"checkout\" component={Checkout} hideNavBar /\u003e\n```\n\nIn the components folder, create a new file named `ShippingAddress.js` and you can add the following code to it:\n\n```\n// Importing a few package and components\nimport { View, StyleSheet, Text, TextInput } from \"react-native\";\nimport React, { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { heightToDp } from \"rn-responsive-screen\";\n\nexport default function ShippingAddress({ onChange }) {\n  // Passing onChange as a prop\n\n  // Declaring a few states to store the user's input\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState(\"\");\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState(\"\");\n  const [AddressLine1, setAddressLine1] = useState(\"\");\n  const [AddressLine2, setAddressLine2] = useState(\"\");\n  const [city, setCity] = useState(\"\");\n  const [country, setCountry] = useState(\"\");\n  const [province, setProvince] = useState(\"\");\n  const [postalCode, setPostalCode] = useState(\"\");\n  const [phone, setPhone] = useState(\"\");\n  const [company, setCompany] = useState(\"\");\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState(\"\");\n\n  // Function to handle the user's input\n  const handleChange = () =\u003e {\n    // Creating an object to store the user's input\n    let address = {\n      first_name: firstName,\n      last_name: lastName,\n\t\t\temail,\n      address_1: AddressLine1,\n      address_2: AddressLine2,\n      city,\n      province,\n      postal_code: postalCode,\n      phone,\n      company,\n\t\t\tcountry\n    };\n    // Calling the onChange function and passing the address object as an argument\n    onChange(address);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    // Creating a view to hold the user's input\n    \u003cView style={styles.container}\u003e\n      {/* Creating a text input for the user's first name */}\n      \u003cTextInput\n        onChangeText={(e) =\u003e {\n          // Setting the user's input to the firstName state\n          setFirstName(e);\n          // Calling the handleChange function\n          handleChange();\n        }}\n        placeholder=\"First Name\"\n        style={styles.input}\n      /\u003e\n      \u003cTextInput\n        onChangeText={(e) =\u003e {\n          setLastName(e);\n          handleChange();\n        }}\n        placeholder=\"Last Name\"\n        style={styles.input}\n      /\u003e\n\t\t \u003cTextInput\n        onChangeText={(e) =\u003e {\n          setEmail(e);\n          handleChange();\n        }}\n        placeholder=\"Email\"\n        style={styles.input}\n      /\u003e\n      \u003cTextInput\n        onChangeText={(e) =\u003e {\n          setAddressLine1(e);\n          handleChange();\n        }}\n        placeholder=\"Address Line 1\"\n        style={styles.input}\n      /\u003e\n      \u003cTextInput\n        onChangeText={(e) =\u003e {\n          setAddressLine2(e);\n          handleChange();\n        }}\n        placeholder=\"Address Line 2\"\n        style={styles.input}\n      /\u003e\n      \u003cTextInput\n        onChangeText={(e) =\u003e {\n          setCity(e);\n          handleChange();\n        }}\n        placeholder=\"City\"\n        style={styles.input}\n      /\u003e\n      \u003cTextInput\n        onChangeText={(e) =\u003e {\n          setCountry(e);\n          handleChange();\n        }}\n        placeholder=\"Country\"\n        style={styles.input}\n      /\u003e\n      \u003cTextInput\n        onChangeText={(e) =\u003e {\n          setProvince(e);\n          handleChange();\n        }}\n        placeholder=\"Province\"\n        style={styles.input}\n      /\u003e\n      \u003cTextInput\n        onChangeText={(e) =\u003e {\n          setPostalCode(e);\n          handleChange();\n        }}\n        placeholder=\"Postal Code\"\n        style={styles.input}\n      /\u003e\n      \u003cTextInput\n        onChangeText={(e) =\u003e {\n          setPhone(e);\n          handleChange();\n        }}\n        placeholder=\"Phone\"\n        style={styles.input}\n      /\u003e\n      \u003cTextInput\n        onChangeText={(e) =\u003e {\n          setCompany(e);\n          handleChange();\n        }}\n        placeholder=\"Company\"\n        style={styles.input}\n      /\u003e\n    \u003c/View\u003e\n  );\n}\n\n// Creating a stylesheet to style the view\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    marginTop: heightToDp(2),\n  },\n  input: {\n    borderWidth: 1,\n    padding: 12,\n    borderColor: \"#E5E5E5\",\n    borderRadius: 5,\n    marginTop: 10.2,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nIn the above code, you imported a few components and created a function that handles the `onChange` event for the inputs. You have also created a few `TextInputs` for the shipping address.\n\nCreate a new file named `RadioButton.js` in the components folder and add the below code to it. It is a very simple component that will render radio buttons:\n\n```\nimport { View, Text, StyleSheet, TouchableOpacity } from \"react-native\";\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nconst RadioButton = ({ onPress, selected, children }) =\u003e {\n  return (\n    \u003cView style={styles.radioButtonContainer}\u003e\n      \u003cTouchableOpacity onPress={onPress} style={styles.radioButton}\u003e\n        {selected ? \u003cView style={styles.radioButtonIcon} /\u003e : null}\n      \u003c/TouchableOpacity\u003e\n      \u003cTouchableOpacity onPress={onPress}\u003e\n        \u003cText style={styles.radioButtonText}\u003e{children}\u003c/Text\u003e\n      \u003c/TouchableOpacity\u003e\n    \u003c/View\u003e\n  );\n};\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  radioButtonContainer: {\n    flexDirection: \"row\",\n    alignItems: \"center\",\n    marginRight: 45,\n  },\n  radioButton: {\n    height: 20,\n    width: 20,\n    backgroundColor: \"#F8F8F8\",\n    borderRadius: 10,\n    borderWidth: 1,\n    borderColor: \"#E6E6E6\",\n    alignItems: \"center\",\n    justifyContent: \"center\",\n  },\n  radioButtonIcon: {\n    height: 14,\n    width: 14,\n    borderRadius: 7,\n    backgroundColor: \"#C37AFF\",\n  },\n  radioButtonText: {\n    fontSize: 16,\n    marginLeft: 16,\n  },\n});\nexport default RadioButton;\n```\n\nCreate another file named `stripe.js` in the constants folder and add the below code. Make sure to update the `YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` with your publishable key:\n\n```\n\nconst publishable_key = \"YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY\";\n\nexport { publishable_key };\n```\n\nNext, install the Stripe SDK for react native using the command below:\n\n```\nnpm install @stripe/stripe-react-native\n```\n\nNow,  update the checkout screen (`screens/Checkout.js`) by replacing the imports with the below components and dependencies:\n\n```\nimport { View, Text, StyleSheet } from \"react-native\";\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from \"react\";\nimport Header from \"../components/Header\";\nimport axios from \"axios\";\nimport baseURL from \"../constants/url\";\nimport { ScrollView } from \"react-native-gesture-handler\";\nimport { SafeAreaView } from \"react-native-safe-area-context\";\nimport { heightToDp, widthToDp } from \"rn-responsive-screen\";\nimport Button from \"../components/Button\";\nimport ShippingAddress from \"../components/ShippingAddress\";\nimport Payment from \"../components/Payment\";\nimport { publishable_key } from \"../constants/stripe\";\nimport RadioButton from \"../components/RadioButton\";\nimport { CardField, useStripe } from \"@stripe/stripe-react-native\";\nimport AsyncStorage from \"@react-native-async-storage/async-storage\";\nimport { StripeProvider } from \"@stripe/stripe-react-native\";\n```\n\nNext, create a few `useStates` that will be used to capture the input values in the `Checkout` component:\n\n```\nconst [paymentInfo, setPaymentInfo] = useState({});\nconst [shippingAddress, setShippingAddress] = useState({});\nconst [shippingOptions, setShippingOptions] = useState([]);\nconst [selectedShippingOption, setSelectedShippingOption] = useState(\"\");\nconst [paymentSession, setPaymentSession] = useState({});\n\nconst { confirmPayment } = useStripe();\n```\n\nCreate two functions that will be used to capture the input values that we will declare later on.\n\n```\n// const [selectedShippingOption, setSelectedShippingOption] = useState(\"\");\n// ......\n\n  const handlePaymentInputChange = (card) =\u003e {\n    setPaymentInfo(card.values);\n  };\n\n  const handleAddressInputChange = (address) =\u003e {\n    setShippingAddress(address);\n  };\n```\n\nWhen the page opens and before the payment providers are displayed to the customer to choose from, you must initialize the [payment sessions](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/payment/overview#payment-session). To do that, we create a function named `InitializePaymentSessions` and call it on `useEffect` function. Here is what the code should look like:\n\n```\nconst InitializePaymentSessions = async () =\u003e {\n    // Getting cart id from async storage\n    let cart_id = await AsyncStorage.getItem(\"cart_id\");\n    // Intializing payment session\n    axios\n      .post(`${baseURL}/store/carts/${cart_id}/payment-sessions`)\n      .then(({ data }) =\u003e {\n        axios\n          .post(`${baseURL}/store/carts/${cart_id}/payment-session`, {\n            provider_id: \"stripe\",\n          })\n          .then(({ data }) =\u003e {\n            setPaymentSession(data.cart.payment_session);\n          });\n      });\n  };\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    // Calling the function to fetch the payment options when the component mounts\n    fetchPaymentOption();\n  }, []);\n```\n\nNext, create other functions to handle payment. Add the below functions the the `Checkout.js` :\n\n```\nconst handlePayment = async () =\u003e {\n\t\t\n\t\t// Getting client secret from the payment session state\n    const clientSecret = paymentSession.data ? paymentSession.data.client_secret : paymentSession.client_secret\n\n    const billingDetails = {\n      email: shippingAddress.email,\n      phone: shippingAddress.phone,\n      addressCity: shippingAddress.city,\n      addressCountry: shippingAddress.country,\n      addressLine1: shippingAddress.address_1,\n      addressLine2: shippingAddress.address_2,\n      addressPostalCode: shippingAddress.postalCode,\n    };\n    const { error, paymentIntent } = await confirmPayment(clientSecret, {\n      type: \"Card\",\n      billingDetails,\n    });\n\t\tif (error) {\n      alert(\"Payment failed\", error);\n    }\n    if (paymentIntent) {\n      alert(\"Payment successful\");\n\t\t\t\n// Calling the complete cart function to empty the cart and redirect to the home screen\n    completeCart();\n    }\n\t\n  };\n\nconst completeCart = async () =\u003e {\n    const cartId = await AsyncStorage.getItem(\"cart_id\");\n\n    // Sending a request to the server to empty the cart\n    axios\n      .post(`${baseURL}/store/carts/${cartId}/complete`)\n      .then(async (res) =\u003e {\n        // Removing the cart_id from the local storage\n        await AsyncStorage.removeItem(\"cart_id\");\n        // Redirecting to the home screen\n        Actions.push(\"products\");\n      });\n  };\n\n  // Calling the API when user presses the \"Place Order\" button\n  const placeOrder = async () =\u003e {\n    // Getting cart id from async storage\n    let cart_id = await AsyncStorage.getItem(\"cart_id\");\n    // Post shipping address to server\n    axios\n      .post(`${baseURL}/store/carts/${cart_id}`, {\n        shipping_address: shippingAddress,\n      })\n      .then(({ data }) =\u003e {\n        // Post shipping method to server\n        axios\n          .post(`${baseURL}/store/carts/${cart_id}/shipping-methods`, {\n            option_id: selectedShippingOption,\n          })\n          .then(({ data }) =\u003e {\n            // Calling the handle Payment API\n            handlePayment();\n          });\n      });\n  };\n\n  const fetchPaymentOption = async () =\u003e {\n    // Getting cart id from async storage\n    let cart_id = await AsyncStorage.getItem(\"cart_id\");\n\n    // Fetch shipping options from server\n    axios\n      .get(`${baseURL}/store/shipping-options/${cart_id}`)\n      .then(({ data }) =\u003e {\n        setShippingOptions(data.shipping_options);\n        // Initializing payment session\n        InitializePaymentSessions();\n      });\n  };\n\n```\n\nThese functions handle retrieving payment and shipping options from Medusa. It also handles processing the payment through Stripe, and then handles the checkout in Medusa.\n\nYou can also replace the return function with the below code:\n\n```\nreturn (\n\u003cStripeProvider publishableKey={publishable_key}\u003e\n    \u003cSafeAreaView style={styles.container}\u003e\n      \u003cScrollView\u003e\n        \u003cHeader title=\"Checkout\" /\u003e\n        \u003cView style={styles.address}\u003e\n          \u003cText style={styles.title}\u003eShipping Address\u003c/Text\u003e\n          \u003cShippingAddress onChange={handleAddressInputChange} /\u003e\n        \u003c/View\u003e\n\n        \u003cView style={styles.payment}\u003e\n          \u003cText style={styles.title}\u003ePayment\u003c/Text\u003e\n          \u003cCardField\n            postalCodeEnabled={false}\n            placeholders={{\n              number: \"4242 4242 4242 4242\",\n            }}\n            cardStyle={{\n              backgroundColor: \"#FFFFFF\",\n              textColor: \"#000000\",\n            }}\n            style={{\n              width: \"100%\",\n              height: 50,\n              marginVertical: 30,\n            }}\n            onCardChange={(cardDetails) =\u003e {\n              handlePaymentInputChange(cardDetails);\n            }}\n            onFocus={(focusedField) =\u003e {\n              console.log(\"focusField\", focusedField);\n            }}\n          /\u003e\n        \u003c/View\u003e\n        \u003cView style={styles.shipping}\u003e\n          \u003cText style={styles.title}\u003eShipping Options\u003c/Text\u003e\n          {shippingOptions.map((option) =\u003e (\n            \u003cView style={styles.shippingOption}\u003e\n              \u003cRadioButton\n                onPress={() =\u003e setSelectedShippingOption(option.id)}\n                key={option.id}\n                selected={selectedShippingOption === option.id}\n                children={option.name}\n              /\u003e\n            \u003c/View\u003e\n          ))}\n\n          \u003cButton onPress={placeOrder} large title=\"Place Order\" /\u003e\n        \u003c/View\u003e\n      \u003c/ScrollView\u003e\n    \u003c/SafeAreaView\u003e\n\u003c/StripeProvider\u003e\n  );\n\n```\n\nLastly, add the below style object at the end of the file:\n\n```\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    backgroundColor: \"#fff\",\n  },\n  address: {\n    marginHorizontal: widthToDp(5),\n  },\n  payment: {\n    marginHorizontal: widthToDp(5),\n    marginTop: heightToDp(4),\n  },\n  shipping: {\n    marginHorizontal: widthToDp(5),\n  },\n  title: {\n    fontSize: widthToDp(4.5),\n  },\n  shippingOption: {\n    marginTop: heightToDp(2),\n  },\n});\n```\n\nAnd that’s it! You should now be able to make payments and purchase items from the store.\n\n### Test Checkout\n\nNow, try adding a few items to the cart and navigate to the checkout screen, you should be able to add an address and make payment. Here is what the checkout screen should look like:\n\n![](/images/Screenshot\\_2022-09-06\\_at\\_3.13.44\\_AM.png)\n\n## **What’s Next?**\n\nThis article is part 2 of **Creating an ecommerce app using Medusa and React Native**.

They used an online store where you can browse for different toys, buy them online, and have them shipped right to your door.\n\nThese online stores are created using tools like Medusa. Medusa allows store owners to create online stores that are later used to buy different items, such as a lego set.\n\n## Explained to a Teen 👧\n\nEcommerce online stores allow store owners to showcase their products to their customers. The customers then can buy some of these products using different payment methods, such as Stripe or PayPal, then have these items shipped to their door using the shipping method of their choice.\n\nFor store owners to create an ecommerce store, they generally need an ecommerce platform that builds the basics for them, such as creating products, storing customer information and handling products.\n\nMedusa is an ecommerce platform that was built for software developers. It is a free platform that can be used for any type of ecommerce store, and it can be customized with different options to make the customer’s experience more unique.\n\n## Explained to a College Graduate 👩‍🎓\n\nEcommerce platforms power up all ecommerce online stores that we see today. Medusa is one of those platforms, but a few characteristics sets it apart:\n\n*   **Open Source:** A software that is open source is a software that is open to the public. Anyone can check the code at any time, and anyone can use it for their projects for free. It can be used as-is, or it can be modified for different purposes as every line of code can be changed.\n*   **Easy-to-use:** Medusa’s [intuitive admin panel](https://docs.medusajs.com/user-guide/) makes it easy for store owners to customize their store and perform advanced tasks such as handling order returns and exchanges.\n*   **Flexibility:** Medusa does not force store operators or developers to use a set of services that they do not need. If a store operator can benefit from using Stripe, they can use it as a payment method for their store. If they instead prefer using PayPal, they can use that instead. They can also use both! There are no limitations to the services that can be used in Medusa.\n\n## Explained to an Intern Developer 🙍‍♀️\n\nMedusa is an open source Node.js ecommerce platform that aims to provide a great developer experience. Whether you’re a beginner or an expert, you can use Medusa if you have some knowledge of JavaScript or TypeScript.\n\nMedusa is easy to get started with. All you need is to follow [three steps to get started with Medusa](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start) and set up your first online store.\n\nMedusa’s open source nature makes it highly flexible and customizable. You can use it to build a traditional ecommerce store or more advanced business models such as subscription-based ecommerce stores.\n\nMedusa also provides storefronts built with [Gatsby](https://docs.medusajs.com/starters/gatsby-medusa-starter) and [Next.js](https://docs.medusajs.com/starters/nextjs-medusa-starter), which are open source static-site generators that make your ecommerce website blazingly fast.\n\n[Medusa’s Discord community](https://discord.gg/medusajs) is welcoming to all developers of different levels that are interested in learning more about Medusa and want to receive help during the process. The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) can also be used to submit any issues or participate in discussions.\n\n## Explained to an Expert Developer 🦸‍♀️\n\nMedusa is an open source composable commerce platform built with Node.js. Its main purpose is to provide a great developer experience that allows developers to build any type of ecommerce solution without hacky workarounds.\n\nMedusa’s architecture is composed of three components:\n\n*   **The backend** is the core of the ecommerce store. This is where all data and processing logic is stored. Other components in the architecture interact with the backend to perform any ecommerce operation or retrieve the store’s data.\n*   **The storefront** is what customers use to buy products from the ecommerce store. Medusa provides two storefronts, one built with [Gatsby](https://docs.medusajs.com/starters/gatsby-medusa-starter) and one with [Next.js](https://docs.medusajs.com/starters/nextjs-medusa-starter). You can also build your own storefront with any frontend framework by using the [Storefront APIs](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store).\n*   **The Medusa admin** is an intuitive admin panel that can be used by store operators to manage their ecommerce store. Store operators can manage products, orders, discounts, and more features that the ecommerce store provides. You can either use [Medusa’s admin panel](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/quickstart) or build your own using the [Admin APIs](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin/).\n\nAs an ecommerce platform, Medusa provides many advanced features on top of the basic ecommerce features, including automated RMA flows, Sales Channels, Automated tax calculation, and [more](https://docs.medusajs.com/#features).\n\nThe Medusa server’s architecture is built with abstract layers that allow you to extend any part of the server to provide additional services seamlessly. Medusa can also be integrated with any third-party services hassle-free using its plugin system.\n\nSome of the existing plugins to integrate Medusa into third-party services are [Stripe](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/stripe), [Contentful](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/contentful/), [Algolia](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/algolia), [Slack](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/slack), and more. You can also [create your own plugin](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/plugins/create) to use on your server or share it with the community.\n\n## Want to Learn More About Medusa?\n\nIf you’re interested in getting started with Medusa, check out our [quickstart guide to get started in three easy steps](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#install-locally).\n\nYou can learn more about Medusa and how to use it in our [Documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/).\n\nIf you need any help while using Medusa or just want to chat with the core team behind Medusa and the community, please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/medusajs).\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/how-to-create-an-ecommerce-app-with-medusa-and-ionic.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/how-to-create-an-ecommerce-app-with-medusa-and-ionic.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/how-to-create-an-ecommerce-app-with-medusa-and-ionic.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"How to Create An Ecommerce App with Medusa and Ionic","date":"2022-08-25","excerpt":"Learn how to build a powerful ecommerce application with this  step-by-step tutorial using Medusa's server and Ionic SDK.

Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\n[Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) is an open source toolkit that allows developers to create cross-platform apps that support a variety of mobile platforms, including Android and iOS. Developers can build with their frontend framework of choice, including Angular, Vue and React.\n\n[Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) is an open source composable ecommerce platform that allows developers to create their own customizable and extendable online store. Medusa aims to provide developers with a great experience creating unique ecommerce stores.\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll build an ecommerce app using Medusa and Ionic. This app can then be used on mobile phones such as Android, iOS and Windows phones, and can also be used as a progressive web app (PWA).\n\nYou can view the source code for the tutorial in [this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/silvia-odwyer/ionic-medusajs-ecommerce-app).\n\n![](/images/Screen_Recording\\_2022-08-17\\_at\\_10.28.03\\_AM.gif)\n\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo use Medusa, you need Node.js (version 14+) installed on your machine. You can download it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).\n\n## Set up the Medusa Server\n\nFirst, install the Medusa CLI by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n```\nnpm install -g @medusajs/medusa-cli\n```\n\nNext, run the following command to create a new Medusa server:\n\n```\nmedusa new ecommerce-store-server --seed\n```\n\nThe `--seed` flag populates the database with demo data that can then be used as part of the ecommerce store later on.\n\nFinally, navigate to the `ecommerce-store-server` directory and start the server:\n\n```\ncd ecommerce-store-server\nmedusa develop\n```\n\nIf the server runs successfully, you should see in your terminal an output similar to this:\n\n![](/images/Medusa_server_console_output.jpg)\n\n\n\n## Install Medusa Admin\n\nNext up, it's time to setup and run the Medusa Admin dashboard. In a separate directory, run the following command:\n\n```\ngit clone [https://github.com/medusajs/admin](https://github.com/medusajs/admin) medusa-admin\n```\n\nNavigate into the newly-created `medusa-admin` directory and install the dependencies for the project:\n\n```\ncd medusa-admin\nnpm install\n```\n\nThen, to run the admin, execute the following command in your terminal:\n\n```\nnpm run develop\n```\n\nThis runs the Medusa admin on `localhost:7000`. Make sure the Medusa server is also still running.\n\nIf you open the Medusa Admin, you should see a login page.\n\n![](/images/Login_to_Medusa_Admin.png)\n\n\n\nLogin screen for Medusa Admin\n\nSince you created a Medusa server in the previous section with the `--seed` flag, a test user was created in addition to the demo data. So, you can use the email `admin@medusa-test.com` and password `supersecret` to log in.\n\nThe Medusa admin includes many functionalities such as viewing orders, managing products, configuring your store and regions, and much more!\n\nYou can try editing some of the existing demo products or adding new products in the Medusa admin.\n\n![](/images/Editing_products_in_Medusa_Admin.png)\n\n\n\nEditing a product’s metadata in Medusa Admin\n\n## Initialize An Ionic Project\n\nIn this section, you’ll start building the Ionic app.\n\nFirst, install the Ionic CLI by running the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install -g @ionic/cli\n```\n\nThen, in a separate directory, create a new Ionic app using the following command:\n\n```\nionic start ecommerce-store blank --type=react\n```\n\nThis tutorial uses React to create the Ionic app. This is specified as part of the command above with the `--type` flag.\n\nIt usually takes several minutes to install all the dependencies required for the project.\n\nOnce the installation is done, change to the `ecommerce-store` directory and install the other dependencies required:\n\n```\ncd ecommerce-store\nnpm install axios\n```\n\n`axios` is used to send asynchronous requests to the Medusa server. This will allow you to perform operations such as fetching products.\n\n### Testing the Ionic App\n\nTo test out the blank ionic app, run the following command in your terminal:\n\n```\nionic serve --lab\n```\n\nThis runs a development Ionic server on `localhost:8100` and the Ionic Lab on `localhost:8200`. You can use the Ionic Lab to simulate how the app looks like on different devices such as iOS or Android.\n\n![](/images/Ionic_Lab.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Change Store CORS Variable\n\nSince the Ionic app runs on port 8100, you need to update the Store CORS settings on your Medusa server in the `medusa-config.js` file to the following:\n\n```\nconst STORE_CORS = process.env.STORE_CORS || \"http://localhost:8100\"\n```\n\nFor more information, check out this [official guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/troubleshooting/cors-issues/) on updating your CORS settings.\n\nMake sure to restart the Medusa server after making this change.\n\n## Create Product Item Cards\n\nIn this section, you’ll create a reusable component to display products as cards on the home page.\n\nFirst, you need to create two interfaces, one for products and another for images. These interfaces will be used to define the structure of a product and an image.\n\nTo do that, create the file `src/Interfaces.tsx` with the following content:\n\n```\nexport interface Product {\n    id: string;\n    title: string;\n    handle: string;\n    images: Image[];\n    description: string;\n    variants: any[];\n}\n\nexport interface Image {\n    url: string;\n}\n```\n\nNext, you’ll create the reusable product item card component.\n\nNow that the interfaces are defined and exported, it’s time to create the UI for the product item cards.\n\nCreate a new file `src/components/ProductItemCard/ProductItemCard.tsx` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport React, { useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { IonCard, IonCardHeader, IonCardSubtitle, IonImg, IonCardTitle } from '@ionic/react';\nimport { Product } from '../../Interfaces';\n\nconst ProductItemCard = ({ product }: { product: Product }) =\u003e {\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      {product \u0026\u0026 (\n        \u003cIonCard routerLink={\"/product/\" + product[\"id\"]} className=\"product_card\"\u003e\n          \u003cIonImg src={product.images[0][\"url\"]} class=\"image\" /\u003e\n          \u003cIonCardHeader\u003e\n            \u003cIonCardTitle className=\"product_title\"\u003e\u003cb\u003e{product[\"title\"]}\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/IonCardTitle\u003e\n            \u003cIonCardSubtitle\u003e{product[\"handle\"]}\u003c/IonCardSubtitle\u003e\n            \u003cIonCardSubtitle\u003e${product[\"variants\"][0][\"prices\"][1][\"amount\"] / 100}\u003c/IonCardSubtitle\u003e\n          \u003c/IonCardHeader\u003e\n        \u003c/IonCard\u003e\n      )}\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ProductItemCard;\n```\n\nEach card displays the image, title, type and price of a product. A product prop will be passed to the component, and its corresponding metadata is then displayed. The `Product` interface is used to enforce the type of the `product` prop.\n\n## Create the Home layout\n\nNow that the component for individual product cards has been created, it’s time to fetch and render the products in the Home layout screen.\n\nThe `Home.tsx` and `Home.css` files are created by default in `src/pages` when you initialize an Ionic project. Create a new directory `src/pages/Home` and move `Home.tsx` and `Home.css` into the `src/pages/Home` directory.\n\n### Edit the Header\n\nIf you open the `src/pages/Home/Home.tsx` file and take a look at the returned JSX, you'll see a header has automatically been added for you. You can replace the text nested in the component `IonTitle` with the name of your ecommerce store. For example:\n\n```\n\u003cIonHeader\u003e\n    \u003cIonToolbar\u003e\n      \u003cIonTitle\u003eMedusa Ecommerce Store\u003c/IonTitle\u003e\n    \u003c/IonToolbar\u003e\n\u003c/IonHeader\u003e\n```\n\n### Fetch Products from the Medusa Server\n\nCreate the file `src/server-url.js` with the following content:\n\n```\nconst medusaServerBaseURL = \"http://localhost:9000\";\n\nexport default medusaServerBaseURL;\n```\n\nIt’s useful to define the base URL of the Medusa server in one file. Then, if the port or URL needs to be updated, you only need to update the URL in this file.\n\nIf you’re testing on a mobile device, the URL should be changed to your machine’s IP.\n\nNext, in `src/pages/Home/Home.tsx`, replace the imports at the beginning of the file with the following:\n\n```\nimport { IonContent, IonHeader, IonPage, IonTitle, IonToolbar, IonGrid, IonRow, IonCol, } from '@ionic/react';\nimport './Home.css';\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport axios from \"axios\";\nimport ProductItemCard from '../../components/ProductItemCard/ProductItemCard';\nimport medusaServerBaseURL from \"../../server-url\";\n```\n\nThen, create a state variable inside the `Home` component to store the products:\n\n```\nconst [products, setProducts] = useState([]);\n```\n\nAnd add the following after creating the state variable:\n\n```\nuseEffect(() =\u003e {\n    axios\n      .get(`${medusaServerBaseURL}/store/products`)\n      .then((response) =\u003e {\n\n        if (response.data) {\n          let products = response.data.products;\n\n          setProducts(products);\n        }\n      })\n      .catch((err) =\u003e {\n        console.log(\"error\", err)\n      });\n  }, []);\n```\n\nWith `useEffect`, the Home component will fetch the products from the server when the screen first opens. A request is sent with `axios` to the [List Products](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store/#tag/Product/operation/GetProducts) endpoint. Then, the result is used to set the `products` state variable.\n\n### Create A Grid of Products\n\nNext up, it’s time to create a grid of product items using the `\u003cIonGrid\u003e` component.\n\nStill in `src/pages/Home/Home.tsx`, add the following within the `\u003cIonContent\u003e` element in the returned JSX, replacing the `\u003cExploreContainer\u003e` component:\n\n```\n\u003cIonGrid class=\"ion-no-padding ion-no-margin\"\u003e\n    \u003cIonRow\u003e\n     {products.map((product, i) =\u003e\n         \u003cIonCol size=\"6\"\u003e\n             \u003cProductItemCard product={product} /\u003e\n         \u003c/IonCol\u003e)}\n     \u003c/IonRow\u003e\n\u003c/IonGrid\u003e\n```\n\nThis grid renders each product using the `ProductItemCard` component. Two products are displayed per row, but if you’d like to alter this to a single product per row, update the `size` prop for the `IonCol` element to `12`. For more information on grids in Ionic, be sure to take a look at the [official documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/layout/grid).\n\n### Add the CSS\n\nChange the content of `src/pages/Home/Home.css` to add some helpful styling:\n\n```\n.product_card {\n    cursor: pointer;\n}\n\n.product_title {\n    font-size: 1em;\n}\n```\n\n### Testing the Home Screen\n\nMake sure that the Medusa server is still running and re-run the Ionic server if it’s not still running.\n\nIf you open the app now in Ionic lab, you should see on the Home screen the products fetched from your Medusa server.\n\nPlease note that the screenshot shown is in dark mode due to system preferences. If you use light mode, the screen will look different.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-08-17\\_at\\_11.08.34\\_AM.png)\n\n\n\nHome screen for the app, listing the products in a grid display\n\n## Create the ProductDetail Screen\n\nIn this section, you’ll create the `ProductDetail` screen. This screen will display the individual product’s information and image.\n\nCreate the file `src/pages/ProductDetailPage/ProductDetailPage.tsx` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { IonContent, IonHeader, IonPage, IonTitle, IonToolbar } from '@ionic/react';\nimport './ProductDetailPage.css';\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport { IonCard, IonCardHeader, IonBackButton, IonButtons, IonCardSubtitle, IonToast, IonImg, IonCardTitle, IonCardContent, IonButton } from '@ionic/react';\nimport axios from \"axios\";\nimport { RouteComponentProps } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { Product } from '../../Interfaces';\nimport medusaServerBaseURL from \"../../server-url\";\n\nconst ProductDetailPage: React.FC\u003cRouteComponentProps\u003c{ id: string }\u003e\u003e = (props) =\u003e {\n  const [product, setProduct] = useState\u003cProduct\u003e();\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    let product_id = props.match.params.id;\n\n    axios\n      .get(`${medusaServerBaseURL}/store/products/${product_id}`)\n      .then((response) =\u003e {\n        if (response.data.product) {\n          setProduct(response.data.product);\n        }\n      })\n      .catch((err) =\u003e {\n        console.log(\"error\", err)\n      });\n  }, [props.match.params.id])\n\n  return (\n    \u003cIonPage\u003e\n      \u003cIonHeader\u003e\n        \u003cIonToolbar\u003e\n          \u003cIonButtons slot=\"start\"\u003e\n            \u003cIonBackButton text=\"\"\u003e\n            \u003c/IonBackButton\u003e\n          \u003c/IonButtons\u003e\n          \u003cIonTitle\u003eMedusa Ecommerce Store\u003c/IonTitle\u003e\n        \u003c/IonToolbar\u003e\n      \u003c/IonHeader\u003e\n      \u003cIonContent fullscreen\u003e\n\n        {product \u0026\u0026 (\n\n          \u003cIonCard mode=\"ios\"\u003e\n            {product[\"images\"] \u0026\u0026 (\n              \u003cIonImg class=\"product_detail_img\" src={product.images[0][\"url\"]} /\u003e\n            )}\n            \u003cIonCardHeader\u003e\n              \u003cdiv className=\"metaInfo\"\u003e\n                \u003cIonCardTitle\u003e{product[\"title\"]}\u003c/IonCardTitle\u003e\n                \u003cIonCardSubtitle\u003e{product[\"handle\"]}\u003c/IonCardSubtitle\u003e\n                \u003ch3\u003e${product[\"variants\"][0][\"prices\"][1][\"amount\"] / 100}\u003c/h3\u003e\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n\n            \u003c/IonCardHeader\u003e\n            \u003cIonCardContent\u003e\n              \u003ch3\u003eDescription\u003c/h3\u003e\n              {product[\"description\"]}\n              \u003cIonButton class=\"button\" size=\"default\" shape=\"round\" expand=\"block\"\u003eAdd to Cart\u003c/IonButton\u003e\n\n            \u003c/IonCardContent\u003e\n          \u003c/IonCard\u003e\n        )}\n\n      \u003c/IonContent\u003e\n    \u003c/IonPage\u003e\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ProductDetailPage;\n```\n\nIn this page, the product ID is retrieved from the route parameters. Then, the `axios` library is used to send a request to the [Retrieve Product](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store/#tag/Product/operation/GetProductsProduct) endpoint on the Medusa server to retrieve the individual product’s data. Then, the `product` state variable is set using the response of the request.\n\nNext, create the file `src/pages/ProductDetailPage/ProductDetailPage.css` with the following content:\n\n```\n.product_detail_img {\n    height: 30vh;\n    object-fit: cover;\n}\n\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {  \n\th3 {   \n         color: black;  \n    }\n}\n\nh3 {\n    font-weight: bold;\n}\n\n.button {\n    margin-top: 1em;\n}\n\n.metaInfo {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n    flex-wrap: wrap;\n}\n```\n\n### Add a New Route\n\nTo actually use the new screen, it must be added as a new route in the app.\n\nFirst, import the `ProductDetailPage` component in `src/App.tsx`:\n\n```\nimport ProductDetailPage from './pages/ProductDetailPage/ProductDetailPage';\n```\n\nThen, add the new route into the list of routes defined in `App`:\n\n```\nconst App: React.FC = () =\u003e (\n  \u003cIonApp\u003e\n    \u003cIonReactRouter\u003e\n      \u003cIonRouterOutlet\u003e\n        \u003cRoute exact path=\"/home\"\u003e\n          \u003cHome /\u003e\n        \u003c/Route\u003e\n        \u003cRoute exact path=\"/\"\u003e\n          \u003cRedirect to=\"/home\" /\u003e\n        \u003c/Route\u003e\n        \u003cRoute path=\"/product/:id/\" component={ProductDetailPage} /\u003e\n\n      \u003c/IonRouterOutlet\u003e\n    \u003c/IonReactRouter\u003e\n  \u003c/IonApp\u003e\n);\n```\n\n### Test Product Details Screen\n\nWhile the Medusa and Ionic development servers are still running, open the Ionic Lab in your browser and click on one of the products in the home screen. A new screen opens showing the product’s details.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-08-17\\_at\\_11.14.25\\_AM.png)\n\n\n\n### Show Add to Cart Notification\n\nIn this section, you’ll add a simple toast notification when the Add to Cart button is clicked. This doesn’t actually add the product to cart but only simulates the functionality.\n\nIn the `src/pages/ProductDetailPage/ProductDetailPage.tsx` file, add the following after the creation of the `product` state variable to create a new state variable managing the visibility of the toast notification:\n\n```\nconst [showToast, setShowToast] = useState(false);\n```\n\nThen, add an `IonToast` component in the returned JSX. It should be placed within `IonContent` and after the `IonCard` component:\n\n```\n\u003cIonContent fullscreen\u003e\n   {product \u0026\u0026 (\n\n     \u003cIonCard mode=\"ios\"\u003e\n            ...\n     \u003c/IonCard\u003e\n    )}\n\n    \u003cIonToast\n      isOpen={showToast}\n      onDidDismiss={() =\u003e setShowToast(false)}\n      message=\"Product added to cart\"\n      duration={800}\n    /\u003e\n\n\u003c/IonContent\u003e\n```\n\nFinally, change the Add to Cart button to add an `onClick` event handler:\n\n```\n\u003cIonButton class=\"button\" size=\"default\" shape=\"round\" expand=\"block\"  \nonClick={() =\u003e setShowToast(true)}\u003eAdd to Cart\u003c/IonButton\u003e\n```\n\nNow, whenever the button is clicked, the value of `showToast` is set to `true` to show the toast notification.\n\n### Testing the Notification\n\nWhile the Medusa and Ionic development servers are still running, on the details screen of one of the products click the Add to Cart button. A toast notification will then be shown for a few seconds indicating that the product was added to cart.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-08-17\\_at\\_11.20.29\\_AM.png)\n\n\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nBy following this tutorial, you’ve successfully connected your Ionic app to your Medusa server, and fetched products from the server.\n\nMore features can be added using your Medusa server in your Ionic app including:\n\n*   Adding [cart functionalities](https://docs.medusajs.com/guides/carts-in-medusa) that allows the customer to add items to their carts and manage its content.\n*   Implement the [Checkout flow](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/storefront/how-to-implement-checkout-flow/) to allow customers to place an order\n*   Integrating a payment provider such as [Stripe](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/stripe/)\n\n\u003e Should you have any issues or questions related to Medusa, then feel free to reach out to the Medusa team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp).\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/how-to-create-a-wishlist-with-medusa.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/how-to-create-a-wishlist-with-medusa.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/how-to-create-a-wishlist-with-medusa.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"How to Create a Wishlist in Medusa","date":"2022-08-09","excerpt":"In this tutorial, you'll learn how to add wishlist functionality to your Medusa server and Gatsby storefront.","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/wishlist.jpg","altText":"How to Create a Wishlist with Medusa","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-oh4qb9784.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-oh4qb9784.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-oh4qb9784.json"},"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Padilla","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/Carlos.webp","altText":"Person photo"},"type":"Person"}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-29bs7fo47.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json"},"type":"Category","name":"Community"},"markdown_content":"\n\u003ccallout icon=\"exclamationCircleSolid\" button-label=\"Go to Docs\" button-url=\"http://docs.medusajs.com\"\u003e\n**Notice**\nMedusa is under active development, so the content of this post may be outdated. Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\n[Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) is an open source headless commerce that allows you to quickly build an ecommerce platform through its API with just a few commands. In addition to its core that holds all the features an ecommerce requires, Medusa also offers out of the box a ready-made [Gatsby storefront](https://docs.medusajs.com/starters/gatsby-medusa-starter) that you can use to get your ecommerce store up and running.\n\nThis tutorial will guide you through the process of adding wishlist functionality to your Medusa server and then using it to implement a Wishlist flow on a Gatsby storefront.\n\nYou can find the final code for this tutorial in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/carpad88/medusa-server-wishlist) for the Medusa server and [this one for the Gatsby storefront](https://github.com/carpad88/medusa-gatsby-wishlist).\n\n## What you’ll be Creating\n\n### Medusa Server\n\nIn this article, you’ll learn how to set up your medusa server so that you can have a wishlist functionality. In a nutshell, to achieve that, you need to do the following:\n\n*   Add two new tables to your database and the entities that represent them to store customers’ wishlists and wishlist items.\n*   Add a wishlist service with helper methods to perform actions related to the wishlist and wishlist items.\n*   Add custom endpoints to fetch and create wishlists, and add and remove wishlist items.\n\n### Gatsby Storefront\n\nOnce your Medusa server has the wishlist functionality, the next step is to implement the wishlist flow on your Gatsby storefront; this includes the following:\n\n*   A wishlist popover that gives customers a quick view of what is in their wishlist.\n*   Add or remove products to the wishlist from the product detail page.\n*   A wishlist page to list the products saved in their wishlist and remove them.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore you follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have:\n\n*   A Medusa server with some dummy data to work with. If you don’t, please follow the [QuickStart guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start/) to set up a Medusa server first.\n*   As you’ll use migrations in one of the steps, you need to [install PostgreSQL](https://docs.medusajs.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment#postgresql) and [configure it with your Medusa Server](https://docs.medusajs.com/usage/configurations#postgresql-configurations).\n*   This tutorial uses the [Gatsby starter](https://github.com/medusajs/gatsby-starter-medusa) to test the wishlist functionality added to the Medusa server. However, you can still follow along using a different storefront framework.\n\n## Setting up Medusa server\n\n### Add the Wishlist Entity\n\nStart by creating the file `src/models/wishlist.ts` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport {\n  BeforeInsert,\n  Column,\n  Entity,\n  Index,\n  JoinColumn,\n  ManyToOne,\n  OneToMany,\n} from \"typeorm\"\n\nimport { Customer } from \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/models/customer\"\nimport { Region } from \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/models/region\"\nimport { BaseEntity } from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\nimport { generateEntityId } from \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/utils\"\n\n@Entity()\nexport class Wishlist extends BaseEntity {\n  readonly object = \"wishlist\"\n\n  @Index()\n  @Column()\n  region_id: string\n\n  @ManyToOne(() =\u003e Region)\n  @JoinColumn({name: \"region_id\"})\n  region: Region\n\n  @Index()\n  @Column({nullable: true})\n  customer_id: string\n\n  @ManyToOne(() =\u003e Customer)\n  @JoinColumn({name: \"customer_id\"})\n  customer: Customer\n\n  // TODO add wishlish item relation\n\n  @BeforeInsert()\n  private beforeInsert(): void {\n    this.id = generateEntityId(this.id, \"wish\")\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis uses the decorator `@Entity` imported from Typeorm to create the `Wishlist` entity. Then, you create a `Wishlist` class that extends Medusa's `BaseEntity`.\n\nA Wishlist can have many wishlist items, so, later on, you'll edit this entity to add the relation between them.\n\n### Add Wishlist Repository\n\nTo access and modify entity data, you need to create a repository for this entity. Create the file `src/repositories/wishlist.ts` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { EntityRepository, Repository } from \"typeorm\"\nimport { Wishlist } from \"../models/wishlist\"\n\n@EntityRepository(Wishlist)\nexport class WishlistRepository extends Repository\u003cWishlist\u003e { }\n```\n\n### Add Wishlist Item Entity\n\nThe `WishlistItem` entity is a pivot table in the database that indirectly relates a product with a wishlist.\n\nCreate the file `src/models/wishlist-item.ts` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { BeforeInsert, Column, Entity, JoinColumn, ManyToOne, Unique } from \"typeorm\"\nimport { BaseEntity } from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\nimport { generateEntityId } from \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/utils\"\nimport { Product } from '@medusajs/medusa/dist/models/product'\nimport { Wishlist } from './wishlist';\n\n@Entity()\n@Unique([\"wishlist_id\", \"product_id\"])\nexport class WishlistItem extends BaseEntity {\n  @Column()\n  wishlist_id: string\n\n  @ManyToOne(() =\u003e Wishlist, (wishlist) =\u003e wishlist.items)\n  @JoinColumn({name: \"wishlist_id\"})\n  wishlist: Wishlist\n\n  @Column()\n  product_id: string\n\n  @ManyToOne(() =\u003e Product)\n  @JoinColumn({name: \"product_id\"})\n  product: Product\n\n  @BeforeInsert()\n  private beforeInsert(): void {\n    this.id = generateEntityId(this.id, \"item\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis entity has two relationships, one with the **wishlist** and the other one with the **product**. The product relation allows fetching the wishlist item along with the product information.\n\nYou also need to add the relation between the `Wishlist` and the `WishlistItem` entities. In `src/models/wishlist.ts`, replace the `//TODO` with the following:\n\n```\n@OneToMany(() =\u003e WishlistItem, (wishlistItem) =\u003e wishlistItem.wishlist, {\n  onDelete: \"CASCADE\"\n})\nitems: WishlistItem[]\n```\n\nMake sure to import the `WishlistItem` entity at the beginning of the file:\n\n```\nimport { WishlistItem } from './wishlist-item'\n```\n\n### Add Wishlist Item Repository\n\nNext, create the file `src/repositories/wishlist-item.ts` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { EntityRepository, Repository } from \"typeorm\"\nimport { WishlistItem } from '../models/wishlist-item';\n\n@EntityRepository(WishlistItem)\nexport class WishlistItemRepository extends Repository\u003cWishlistItem\u003e { }\n```\n\n### Create migrations\n\nMigrations update the database schema with new tables or make changes to existing tables. You must create a migration for your `Wishlist` and `WishlistItem` entities to reflect them in the database schema.\n\nCreate the file `src/migrations/wishlist.ts` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { MigrationInterface, QueryRunner } from \"typeorm\";\n\nexport class wishlist1655952820403 implements MigrationInterface {\n\n  public async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    // Tables\n    await queryRunner.query(`CREATE TABLE \"wishlist\" ( \"id\" character varying NOT NULL, \"region_id\" character varying NOT NULL, \"customer_id\" character varying, \"created_at\" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(), \"updated_at\" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(), \"deleted_at\" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, CONSTRAINT \"PK_gknmp6lnikxobwv1rhv1dgs982\" PRIMARY KEY (\"id\") )`);\n    await queryRunner.query(`CREATE TABLE \"wishlist_item\" ( \"id\" character varying NOT NULL, \"wishlist_id\" character varying, \"product_id\" character varying, \"created_at\" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(), \"updated_at\" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(), \"deleted_at\" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, CONSTRAINT \"PK_7p8joiapu4u0dxbsatkm5n1qs2\" PRIMARY KEY (\"wishlist_id\", \"product_id\") )`);\n\n    // Foreign key constraints\n    await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE \"wishlist\" ADD CONSTRAINT \"FK_auvt4ec8rnokwoadgpxqf9bf66\" FOREIGN KEY (\"region_id\") REFERENCES \"region\"(\"id\") ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION`);\n    await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE \"wishlist\" ADD CONSTRAINT \"FK_5ix0u284wt3tmrlpb56ppzmxi7\" FOREIGN KEY (\"customer_id\") REFERENCES \"customer\"(\"id\") ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION`);\n    await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE \"wishlist_item\" ADD CONSTRAINT \"FK_vovw0ddpagwehc13uw0q8lrw2o\" FOREIGN KEY (\"wishlist_id\") REFERENCES \"wishlist\"(\"id\") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE NO ACTION`);\n    await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE \"wishlist_item\" ADD CONSTRAINT \"FK_1cvf31byyh136a7744qmdt03yh\" FOREIGN KEY (\"product_id\") REFERENCES \"product\"(\"id\") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE NO ACTION`);\n  }\n\n  public async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE \"wishlist\" DROP CONSTRAINT \"FK_auvt4ec8rnokwoadgpxqf9bf66\"`);\n    await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE \"wishlist\" DROP CONSTRAINT \"FK_5ix0u284wt3tmrlpb56ppzmxi7\"`);\n    await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE \"wishlist_item\" DROP CONSTRAINT \"FK_vovw0ddpagwehc13uw0q8lrw2o\"`);\n    await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE \"wishlist_item\" DROP CONSTRAINT \"FK_1cvf31byyh136a7744qmdt03yh\"`);\n    await queryRunner.query(`DROP TABLE \"wishlist\"`);\n    await queryRunner.query(`DROP TABLE \"wishlist_item\"`);\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\nHere, the `up` method runs if the migration hasn't been run before. It creates the `wishlist` and `wishlist_item` tables and adds some foreign keys.\n\n### Add Wishlist Service\n\nOnce your entities are ready, the next step is to create the service that allows you to perform actions related to the wishlist and wishlist items.\n\nCreate the file `src/services/wishlist.ts` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { BaseService } from 'medusa-interfaces'\nimport { MedusaError } from 'medusa-core-utils'\n\nclass WishlistService extends BaseService {\n  constructor({ manager, wishlistRepository, wishlistItemRepository }) {\n    super()\n    this.manager_ = manager\n    this.wishlistRepository_ = wishlistRepository\n    this.wishlistItemRepository_ = wishlistItemRepository\n  }\n\n\tasync create(payload) {\n    return await this.atomicPhase_(async (transactionManager) =\u003e {\n\n      if (!payload.region_id) {\n        throw new MedusaError(MedusaError.Types.INVALID_DATA, `A region_id must be provided when creating a wishlist`)\n      }\n\n      const wishlistRepository = transactionManager.getCustomRepository(this.wishlistRepository_)\n      const createdWishlist = wishlistRepository.create(payload)\n      const { id } = await wishlistRepository.save(createdWishlist)\n\n      const [wishlist] = await wishlistRepository.find({\n        where: { id },\n        relations: ['items', 'items.product']\n      })\n\n      return wishlist\n    })\n  }\n\n  async retrieve(id) {\n    return await this.atomicPhase_(async (transactionManager) =\u003e {\n      const wishlistRepository = transactionManager.getCustomRepository(this.wishlistRepository_)\n\t\t\tconst [wishlist] = await wishlistRepository.find({ \n\t\t\t\t\twhere: { id }, \n\t\t\t\t\trelations: ['items', 'items.product'] \n\t\t\t})\n\n      if (!wishlist) {\n        throw new MedusaError(MedusaError.Types.NOT_FOUND, `Wishlist with ${id} was not found`)\n      }\n\n      return wishlist\n    })\n  }\n\n  async addWishItem(wishlist_id, product_id) {\n    return await this.atomicPhase_(async (transactionManager) =\u003e {\n      const wishlistItemRepository = transactionManager.getCustomRepository(this.wishlistItemRepository_)\n      const wishlistRepository = transactionManager.getCustomRepository(this.wishlistRepository_)\n\n      const [item] = await wishlistItemRepository.find({ where: { wishlist_id, product_id } })\n\n      if (!item) {\n        const createdItem = wishlistItemRepository.create({ wishlist_id, product_id })\n        await wishlistItemRepository.save(createdItem)\n      }\n\n\t\t\tconst [wishlist] = await wishlistRepository.find({\n        where: { id: wishlist_id },\n        relations: ['items', 'items.product']\n      })\n\n      return wishlist\n    })\n  }\n\n  async removeWishItem(id) {\n    return await this.atomicPhase_(async (transactionManager) =\u003e {\n      const wishlistItemRepository = transactionManager.getCustomRepository(this.wishlistItemRepository_)\n      const wishlistRepository = transactionManager.getCustomRepository(this.wishlistRepository_)\n      const [item] = await wishlistItemRepository.find({ where: { id } })\n      const wishlist_id = item.wishlist_id\n\n      if (item) {\n        await wishlistItemRepository.remove(item)\n      }\n\n\t\t\tconst [wishlist] = await wishlistRepository.find({\n        where: { id: wishlist_id },\n        relations: ['items', 'items.product']\n      })\n\n      return wishlist\n    })\n  }\n}\n\nexport default WishlistService\n```\n\nIn the `WishlistService`, you implement four methods:\n\n1.  The `create` method creates a new wishlist.\n2.  The `retrieve` method retrieves a wishlist and wishlist items associated with it using the wishlist’s ID.\n3.  The `addWishItem` method adds a new wishlist item to the wishlist.\n4.  The `removeWishItem` method deletes a wishlist item from a wishlist using the item’s ID.\n\n### Add Wishlist Endpoints\n\nThe last step to finish the Medusa server setup is adding custom endpoints so you can use the wishlist functionality from the Storefront.\n\nFirst, create the file `src/api/wishlist/index.ts` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { json, Router } from 'express'\n\nconst route = Router()\n\nexport default (app) =\u003e {\n  app.use('/store/wishlist', route)\n  route.use(json())\n\n  // Wishlist\n  route.get('/:id', async (req, res) =\u003e {\n    const wishlistService = req.scope.resolve('wishlistService')\n    const wishlist = await wishlistService.retrieve(req.params.id)\n    res.json(wishlist)\n  })\n\n\troute.post('/', async (req, res) =\u003e {\n    const wishlistService = req.scope.resolve('wishlistService')\n    const payload = {region_id: req.body.region_id, customer_id: null}\n\n    if (req.user \u0026\u0026 req.user.customer_id) {\n      const customerService = req.scope.resolve(\"customerService\")\n      const customer = await customerService.retrieve(req.user.customer_id)\n      payload.customer_id = customer.id\n    }\n\n    const wishlist = await wishlistService.create(payload)\n    res.json(wishlist)\n  })\n\n  // Wishlist items\n  route.post('/:id/wish-item', async (req, res) =\u003e {\n    const wishlistService = req.scope.resolve('wishlistService')\n    const wishlist = await wishlistService.addWishItem(req.params.id, req.body.product_id)\n    res.json(wishlist)\n  })\n\n  route.delete('/:id/wish-item/:item_id', async (req, res) =\u003e {\n    const wishlistService = req.scope.resolve('wishlistService')\n    const wishlist = await wishlistService.removeWishItem(req.params.item_id)\n    res.json(wishlist)\n  })\n\n  return app\n}\n```\n\nYou map each endpoint to a method in the `WishlistService`. All endpoints return a wishlist object with its wishlist items.\n\nNext, create the file `src/api/index.ts` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { Router, json } from 'express'\nimport cors from 'cors'\nimport { projectConfig } from '../../medusa-config'\nimport wishlist from './wishlist'\n\nconst corsOptions = {\n  origin: projectConfig.store_cors.split(','),\n  credentials: true\n}\n\nexport default () =\u003e {\n  const app = Router()\n  app.use(cors(corsOptions))\n\n  wishlist(app)\n\n  return app\n}\n```\n\nYou import your wishlist routes to inject them into Medusa's router. Also, you use the `cors` library with Medusa’s CORS options. This allows you to use these endpoints on the Storefront.\n\n## Running Migrations\n\nIn this section, you’ll run the migrations to add the necessary tables for the wishlist functionality to the database.\n\nIn your terminal, run the following commands to transpile the TypeScript files to JavaScript files then run the migrations:\n\n```\nyarn run build \u0026\u0026 medusa migrations run \n```\n\n## Test Wishlist Functionality\n\nStart by running your server:\n\n```\nyarn start\n```\n\nThis starts your server on port `9000`.\n\nTo run the following tests, you need to use a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to easily send requests to your server.\n\n### Test Creating a Wishlist\n\nTo create a wishlist you need to associate it with a region ID. So, send a `GET` request to `localhost:9000/store/regions` to get the available regions on your Medusa server and copy the first region's `id`.\n\nThen, send a `POST` request to `localhost:9000/store/wishlist` and in the body pass the `region_id` you copied. For example:\n\n```\n{\n  \"region_id\": \"reg_01G6MFABCQ6GWK1DZWZJ8P35JM\"\n}\n```\n\nThe request returns a wishlist object like this one:\n\n```\n{\n  \"object\": \"wishlist\",\n  \"region_id\": \"reg_01G6MFABCQ6GWK1DZWZJ8P35JM\",\n  \"customer_id\": null,\n  \"id\": \"wish_01G6MGYVABK9ZXNCP5KM2Y9NFS\",\n\t\"items\": [],\n  \"created_at\": \"2022-06-28T06:46:09.482Z\",\n  \"updated_at\": \"2022-06-28T06:46:09.482Z\"\n}\n```\n\n### Test Add Items to Wishlist\n\nWishlist items are associated with products. So, you need to retrieve a product ID first.\n\nSend a `GET` request to `localhost:9000/store/products` to get the list of products, then, choose one of them and copy its `id`.\n\nNext, send a `POST` request to `localhost:9000/store/wishlist/YOUR_WISHLIST_ID/wish-item` where `YOUR_WISHLIST_ID` is the `id` you got in the previous step. In the body, pass the `product_id` you copied. For example:\n\n```\n{\n    \"product_id\": \"prod_01G6MFABJ7QP3W3R8ZSWYDTNVG\"\n}\n```\n\nThe request returns a wishlist object with one item attached to it:\n\n```\n{\n    \"object\": \"wishlist\",\n    \"items\": [\n        {\n            \"wishlist_id\": \"wish_01G6MGYVABK9ZXNCP5KM2Y9NFS\",\n            \"product_id\": \"prod_01G6MFABJ7QP3W3R8ZSWYDTNVG\",\n            \"product\": {\n                \"id\": \"prod_01G6MFABJ7QP3W3R8ZSWYDTNVG\",\n                \"created_at\": \"2022-06-28T06:17:29.187Z\",\n                \"updated_at\": \"2022-06-28T06:17:29.187Z\",\n                \"deleted_at\": null,\n                \"title\": \"Medusa T-Shirt\",\n                \"subtitle\": null,\n                \"description\": \"Reimagine the feeling of a classic T-shirt.

Create the file `src/icons/wishlist.jsx` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport React from \"react\"\n\nconst WishlistIcon = ({ props, fill }) =\u003e {\n  return (\n    \u003csvg\n      xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n      width=\"1.5rem\"\n      height=\"1.5rem\"\n      viewBox=\"0 0 256 256\"\n      {...props}\n    \u003e\n      {!fill ?

It only shows the product's title and thumbnail, and it's wrapped with a `RegionalLink` component that allows visiting the product detail page.\n\nThe next step is to add a `WishlistContext` to keep the wishlist in sync across the Storefront. It would be best if you had a `useWishlist` hook to access the Medusa context.\n\nCreate the file `src/hooks/use-wishlist.js` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { useContext } from \"react\"\nimport WishlistContext from '../context/wishlist-context'\n\nexport const useWishlist = () =\u003e {\n  const context = useContext(WishlistContext)\n\n  if (!context) {\n    throw new Error(\n      \"useWishlist hook was used but a WishlistContext. Provider was not found in the parent tree. Make sure this is used in a component that is a child of WishlistProvider\"\n    )\n  }\n\n  return context\n}\n```\n\nNext, create the file `src/context/wishlist-context.js` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport React, { createContext, useEffect, useState } from \"react\"\nimport { useRegion } from \"../hooks/use-region\"\nimport { useMedusa } from \"../hooks/use-medusa\"\n\nconst defaultWishlistContext = {\n  wishlist: {\n    items: [],\n  },\n  loading: false,\n  actions: {\n    addItem: async () =\u003e {},\n    removeItem: async () =\u003e {},\n  },\n}\n\nconst WishlistContext = createContext(defaultWishlistContext)\nexport default WishlistContext\n\nconst WISHLIST_ID = \"wishlist_id\"\nconst isBrowser = typeof window !== \"undefined\"\n\nexport const WishlistProvider = props =\u003e {\n  const [wishlist, setWishlist] = useState(defaultWishlistContext.wishlist)\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(defaultWishlistContext.loading)\n  const { region } = useRegion()\n  const { client } = useMedusa()\n\n  const setWishlistItem = wishlist =\u003e {\n    if (isBrowser) {\n      localStorage.setItem(WISHLIST_ID, wishlist.id)\n    }\n    setWishlist(wishlist)\n  }\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    const initializeWishlist = async () =\u003e {\n      const existingWishlistId = isBrowser\n        ? localStorage.getItem(WISHLIST_ID)\n        : null\n\n      if (existingWishlistId \u0026\u0026 existingWishlistId !== \"undefined\") {\n        try {\n          const { data } = await client.axiosClient.get(\n            `/store/wishlist/${existingWishlistId}`\n          )\n\n          if (data) {\n            setWishlistItem(data)\n            return\n          }\n        } catch (e) {\n          localStorage.setItem(WISHLIST_ID, null)\n        }\n      }\n\n      if (region) {\n        try {\n          const { data } = await client.axiosClient.post(\"/store/wishlist\", {\n            region_id: region.id,\n          })\n\n          setWishlistItem(data)\n          setLoading(false)\n        } catch (e) {\n          console.log(e)\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    initializeWishlist()\n  }, [client, region])\n\n  const addWishItem = async product_id =\u003e {\n    setLoading(true)\n    try {\n      const { data } = await client.axiosClient.post(\n        `/store/wishlist/${wishlist.id}/wish-item`,\n        { product_id }\n      )\n      setWishlistItem(data)\n      setLoading(false)\n    } catch (e) {\n      console.log(e)\n    }\n  }\n\n  const removeWishItem = async id =\u003e {\n    setLoading(true)\n    try {\n      const { data } = await client.axiosClient.delete(\n        `/store/wishlist/${wishlist.id}/wish-item/${id}`\n      )\n      setWishlistItem(data)\n      setLoading(false)\n    } catch (e) {\n      console.log(e)\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cWishlistContext.Provider\n      {...props}\n      value={{\n        ...defaultWishlistContext,\n        loading,\n        wishlist,\n        actions: {\n          addWishItem,\n          removeWishItem,\n        },\n      }}\n    /\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nFirst, you define a default wishlist context with some default properties and create a `WishlistContext`. Then, you create a `WishlistProvider` that initializes the wishlist and exposes some methods to add and remove wishlist items from the created Wishlist.\n\nYou need to add the `WishlistContext` to the `MedusaProvider` to be able to use it.\n\nOpen the file `src/context/medusa-context.js`, import the `WishlistProvider` at the beginning of the file, and in the returned JSX in `MedusaProvider` wrap the `CartProvider` with the `WishlistProvider` :\n\n```\nimport { WishlistProvider } from \"./wishlist-context\"\n\nexport const MedusaProvider = ({ children, client }) =\u003e {\n  return (\n    //...\n          \u003cWishlistProvider\u003e\n            \u003cCartProvider\u003e{children}\u003c/CartProvider\u003e\n          \u003c/WishlistProvider\u003e\n    //...\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNext, create the file `src/components/header/wishlist-popover.jsx` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { Menu } from \"@headlessui/react\"\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\"\nimport React from \"react\"\nimport PopoverTransition from \"../popover-transition\"\nimport WishlistIcon from \"../../icons/wishlist\"\nimport WishlistPopoverItem from \"./wishlist-popover-item\"\nimport { useWishlist } from \"../../hooks/use-wishlist\"\n\nconst WishlistPopover = () =\u003e {\n  const { wishlist } = useWishlist()\n  const iconStyle = { className: \"mr-1\" }\n\n  return (\n    \u003cMenu as=\"div\" className=\"relative inline-block text-left mr-2\"\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n        \u003cMenu.Button className=\"inline-flex items-center justify-center w-full rounded p-2 text-sm font-medium hover:opacity-1/2\"\u003e\n          \u003cWishlistIcon props={iconStyle} /\u003e\n          \u003cspan\u003eWish List\u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003c/Menu.Button\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n\n      \u003cPopoverTransition\u003e\n        \u003cMenu.Items className=\"origin-top-right absolute right-0 mt-2 w-96 px-6 py-4 rounded-md shadow-lg bg-white ring-1 ring-black ring-opacity-5 focus:outline-none\"\u003e\n          \u003cdiv className=\"py-1\"\u003e\n            {wishlist.items \u003c 1 ?

Also, you use the `useWishlist` hook to get the wishlist items from the wishlist context and render them in the wishlist popover component.\n\nFinally, to show the `WishlistPopover` in the storefront’s header open the file `src/components/header/index.jsx` and import the component at the beginning of the file:\n\n```\nimport WishlistPopover from \"./wishlist-popover\"\n```\n\nThen, update the `mockData` object by adding the `wishlist` property at the end with some demo data:\n\n```\n\nconst mockData = {\n  customer: {...},\n  cart: {...},\n  regions: [...],\n  wishlist: {\n    items: [\n      {\n        id: \"1\",\n        title: \"Medusa Tote\",\n        thumbnail:\n          \"https://medusa-public-images.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tshirt.png\",\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\nLastly, add the `WishlistPopover` just before the `CartPopover` in the returned JSX:\n\n```\n//...\n\u003cWishlistPopover wishlist={mockData.wishlist} /\u003e\n\u003cCartPopover cart={mockData.cart} /\u003e\n//...\n```\n\n### Test Wishlist Popover\n\nTo test out the Wishlist Popover make sure your Medusa server is running and start your Gatsby storefront:\n\n```\nyarn start\n```\n\nThen, go to the URL `http://localhost:8000`. You should see the wishlist icon in the header on the left of the cart icon. Click on the heart icon and the wishlist popover will be shown.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-06-28\\_at\\_13.39.31.png)\n\n\n\n## Add a wishlist button on the product detail page\n\nYou will implement the functionality to add or remove items to or from the Wishlist in the product detail page.\n\nOpen the file `src/templates/product.js` and at the beginning of the `Product` function add the following snippet just after the `useCart` hook:\n\n```\nconst {\n  wishlist,\n  actions: { addWishItem, removeWishItem },\n} = useWishlist()\n```\n\nYou get access to the wishlist object in the wishlist context and the methods to add and remove wishlist items.\n\nNext, after the `handleAddToCart` function, add a state variable to track whether the product is already on the wishlist or not:\n\n```\nconst [onWishlist, setOnWishlist] = useState(() =\u003e\n  wishlist.items.some(i =\u003e i.product_id === product.id)\n) \n```\n\nDon’t forget to import the `useWishlist` and `useState` hooks at the start of the file\n\n```\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from \"react\"\nimport { useWishlist } from \"../hooks/use-wishlist\"\n```\n\nThen, add the `toggleWishlist` function to add or remove the item from the Wishlist after the `onWishlist` state variable:\n\n```\nconst toggleWishlist = async () =\u003e {\n  if (!onWishlist) {\n    await addWishItem(product.id)\n    setOnWishlist(true)\n  } else {\n    const [item] = wishlist.items.filter(i =\u003e i.product_id === product.id)\n    await removeWishItem(item.id)\n    setOnWishlist(false)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis function is where you use the wishlist actions from the wishlist context. If the item is not on the wishlist, you call the `addWishItem` action. Otherwise, you call the `removeWishItem` action.\n\nTo use this function, find the `\u003ch1\u003e` HTML element that renders the product's title and replaces it with the following code:\n\n```\n// Replace this line\n\u003c!-- \u003ch1 className=\"font-semibold text-3xl\"\u003e{product.title}\u003c/h1\u003e --\u003e\n\n// with this \n\u003cdiv className=\"flex justify-between items-center\"\u003e\n  \u003ch1 className=\"font-semibold text-3xl\"\u003e{product.title}\u003c/h1\u003e\n  \u003cbutton onClick={toggleWishlist}\u003e\n    \u003cWishlistIcon fill={onWishlist} /\u003e\n  \u003c/button\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nYou use the `WishlistIcon` to let customers know if that product is on the Wishlist or not. If the heart icon is outlined, that means the product is not on the Wishlist. Otherwise, if the icon is filled then the product is on the Wishlist.\n\nRemember to import the `WishlistIcon` component at the beginning\n\n```\nimport WishlistIcon from \"../icons/wishlist\"\n```\n\n### Test Wishlist Button\n\nRun your Gatsby Storefront if it’s not running and visit any product detail page. You should see the heart icon on the top-right of the product's info.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-06-28\\_at\\_14.50.46.png)\n\n\n\nIf you click on it, the `addWishItem` action is triggered, then the icon will change to black. In the wishlist popover, you should see the newly added item.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-06-28\\_at\\_15.01.21.png)\n\n\n\nIf you click on it again the `removeWishItem` action is called and the item is deleted from the wishlist.\n\n## Add Wishlist Listing Page\n\nThe last thing to do is to implement the wishlist page to see all the items added to the Wishlist and remove them from it.\n\nCreate the file `src/components/wishlist/wishlist-item.jsx` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport React from \"react\"\nimport WishlistIcon from \"../../icons/wishlist\"\nimport { useWishlist } from \"../../hooks/use-wishlist\"\nimport RegionalLink from \"../utility/regional-link\"\n\nconst WishlistItem = ({ item }) =\u003e {\n  const {\n    actions: { removeWishItem },\n  } = useWishlist()\n  const { product } = item\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv className=\"flex mb-6 last:mb-0\"\u003e\n      \u003cdiv className=\"bg-ui rounded-md overflow-hidden mr-4 max-w-1/4\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg\n          className=\"h-auto w-full object-cover\"\n          src={product.thumbnail}\n          alt={product.title}\n        /\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cdiv className=\"flex text-sm flex-grow py-2 justify-between space-x-8\"\u003e\n        \u003cRegionalLink to={product.handle} className=\"w-full\"\u003e\n          \u003cdiv className=\"flex flex-col justify-between w-full hover:text-green-400\"\u003e\n            \u003cdiv className=\"flex flex-col\"\u003e\n              \u003cp className=\"font-semibold mb-4\"\u003e{product.title}\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003e{product.description}\u003c/p\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n          \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003c/RegionalLink\u003e\n\n        \u003cdiv className=\"flex flex-col justify-between\"\u003e\n          \u003cdiv className=\"flex justify-end w-full\"\u003e\n            \u003cbutton onClick={async () =\u003e await removeWishItem(item.id)}\u003e\n              \u003cWishlistIcon fill={true} /\u003e\n            \u003c/button\u003e\n          \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport default WishlistItem\n```\n\nThis component is responsible for rendering each wishlist item on the wishlist page. It shows the product's image, title, and description. It also has a button with the `WishlistIcon` component to call the `removeWishItem` action.\n\nNext, create the file `src/pages/wishlist.js` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport React from \"react\"\nimport SearchEngineOptimization from \"../components/utility/seo\"\nimport { useWishlist } from '../hooks/use-wishlist'\nimport WishlistItem from '../components/wishlist/wishlist-item'\n\nconst Wishlist = () =\u003e {\n  const { wishlist } = useWishlist()\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv className=\"layout-base\"\u003e\n      \u003cSearchEngineOptimization title=\"Wishlist\" /\u003e\n      \u003cdiv className=\"flex relative flex-col-reverse lg:flex-row mb-24\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv className=\"flex flex-col\"\u003e\n          \u003cdiv className=\"mb-8\"\u003e\n            \u003ch1 className=\"font-semibold text-4xl\"\u003eWish list\u003c/h1\u003e\n          \u003c/div\u003e\n          \u003cdiv className=\"w-full grid grid-cols-2 gap-16\"\u003e\n            {wishlist.items.map(item =\u003e {\n              return (\n                \u003cWishlistItem\n                  key={item.id}\n                  item={item}\n                  currencyCode={wishlist.region?.currency_code || 'usd'}\n                /\u003e\n              )\n            })}\n          \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Wishlist\n```\n\nThis page is straightforward. it gets the wishlist items from the `wishlist` object retrieved using the `useWishlist` hook and renders them on the page.\n\n### Test Wishlist Listing Page\n\nRe-run your Gatsby Storefront and try adding some products to the Wishlist. Once you have some products added, open the wishlist popover and then click on the View Wish List button.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-06-28\\_at\\_16.03.34.png)\n\n\n\nYou’ll then be redirected to the wishlist page where you can view all items in the wishlist.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-06-28\\_at\\_16.04.59.png)\n\n\n\nIf you click on the heart icon next to any of the products, the product gets removed from the wishlist. The wishlist popover will also be updated.\n\n## What’s next\n\nThere are more functionalities you can implement related to the wishlist:\n\n*   Allow moving items from the wishlist to the cart and vice versa.\n*   Allow logged-in customers to have multiple wishlists and update or delete them.\n*   Add notes to wishlist items.\n\nYou can also check out the following resources to dive more into Medusa's core:\n\n*   Learn [how to add a subscriber in your Medusa server](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/subscribers/create-subscriber) that listens to events to perform an action.\n*   Learn [how to send notifications](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/notification/overview) when an event occurs.\n*   Learn [how to extract your wishlist functionality into a medusa plugin.](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/plugins/overview)\n\n\u003e Should you have any issues or questions related to Medusa, then feel free to reach out to the Medusa team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp).\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/medusa-vs-magento-comparing-two-open-source-ecommerce-frameworks.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/medusa-vs-magento-comparing-two-open-source-ecommerce-frameworks.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/medusa-vs-magento-comparing-two-open-source-ecommerce-frameworks.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Medusa vs. Magento: Which is Better to Build your Ecommerce?","date":"2022-07-28","excerpt":"Comparing open source ecommerce platforms - Medusa and Magento -  to help businesses choose the right one for their ecommerce needs.","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/article-cover1.png","altText":"Medusa vs. Magento: Comparing two open source ecommerce frameworks","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"seo_description":"Comparing open source ecommerce platforms - Medusa and Magento - to help businesses choose the right one for their ecommerce needs.","seo_keywords":"open source ecommerce, Magento","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-eb2no2kx3.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-eb2no2kx3.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-eb2no2kx3.json"},"firstName":"Shahed ","lastName":"Nasser","role":"Role","image":{"url":"/images/27354907.jpeg","altText":"Person photo"},"type":"Person"}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-a9wemp4po.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json"},"name":"Other","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"**My background for making this comparison:** I worked with Magento for over the past 3 years across different clients and obtained a deep understanding of its possibilities and limits. Now, I work as a technical writer at Medusa where I obviously have obtained a deep product experience as well.\n\nMagento is an open source monolithic ecommerce platform built with PHP. Magento is a platform that provides many features out-of-the-box such as multi-region support, analytics, bundled products, and more.\n\nAlthough Magento is known to be a complex platform, it can be customized with modules to cater to specific business use cases.\n\n[Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) is an open source composable commerce platform built with Node.js. Medusa also comes with many features out-of-the-box including automated Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) flows, multi-currency and region support, and advanced promotions among other features.\n\nMedusa is built with customization and extendability in mind to provide a better developer experience and allow businesses to build brand-tailored ecommerce experiences.\n\nIn this article, you’ll learn more about the differences between Medusa and Magento Open Source in terms of ecommerce features and developer experience. You’ll also learn in which cases to use each platform.\n\n![](/images/Colorful_Professional_Comparison_Features_Table_Infographic_Graph.png)\n\n## What is Medusa?\n\nReleased in 2021, Medusa is an open source platform that has gained over 10K stars on GitHub in 9 months, with 13K+ stars at the time of writing this article making it the most popular Javascript-based solution on GitHub.\n\nMedusa’s main aim is to ensure that developers have a great experience while building an ecommerce platform. It allows developers to integrate and implement custom features and services without the need for hacks and workarounds.\n\nAlthough still new, Medusa is a growing platform used by businesses making millions of USD in sales and serving countries across the globe. Businesses are gaining interest in Medusa due to how easy it is to customize and maintain the platform.\n\n## What is Magento?\n\nMagento was first released in 2008 and now has over 10K stars on GitHub. It’s an open source platform used by many large corporations due to the features it provides out-of-the-box and the fact that it’s built for big businesses.\n\nMagento is a platform that aims to provide developers with customization capabilities but requires some advanced knowledge of the platform.\n\nIn 2018, Magento was acquired by Adobe. The comparison in this article only covers the open source version of Magento, but will occasionally mention that certain features are only available in the non-open-source Adobe Commerce version.\n\n## Comparison of Ecommerce Features\n\n### RMA Flows\n\nRMA flows allows merchants to handle order returns gracefully within the ecommerce platform. This includes changing the order status, managing accounting and financing details, managing shipping and payment, and more.\n\n#### Medusa\n\nIn Medusa, RMA flows are available out-of-the-box and are automated. Customers can send a request to return an item from the ecommerce storefront, and the store operators can manage the order status, payment, and shipment details all from the Medusa admin.\n\nDevelopers can also add integrations with accounting or finance services to automatically reflect returns on the business’s finances.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-07-04\\_at\\_12.23.59\\_PM.png)\n\n#### Magento\n\nIn Magento, this feature is not available in the open source version. It is only available either through Adobe Commerce or through community and paid modules.\n\n### Multi-Currency and Multi-Region Support\n\n#### Medusa\n\nIn Medusa, this feature is available out-of-the-box. Businesses can create multiple regions and choose settings specific to each region such as the currency. Then, they can manage these regions all from the same store. This eliminates the need to have multiple stores or switch between stores.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-07-04\\_at\\_1.58.19\\_PM.png)\n\nAdditionally, businesses have full freedom to specify the pricing of products for each currency in their store all from the same platform.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-07-04\\_at\\_11.54.47\\_AM.png)\n\n#### Magento\n\nMagento also supports multiple regions and currencies through stores. Magento allows creating multiple stores, with each store having its own settings and currency it supports.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-07-04\\_at\\_1.58.01\\_PM.png)\n\nMerchants can also specify the pricing of a product specific to a store. However, they will have to switch between stores within the admin dashboard to edit a product details. This also applies to all settings specific to any store.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-07-04\\_at\\_12.35.19\\_PM.png)\n\n### Localization\n\n#### Medusa\n\nLocalization is currently not available in Medusa out of the box. However, it can be implemented on the storefront using CMS plugins such as [Contentful](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/contentful). In addition to localization, the integration between Contentful and Medusa allows merchants to use advanced and rich CMS functionalities.\n\n#### Magento\n\nIn Magento, localization is available out-of-the-box. On the admin dashboard, merchants can create a store for every language they want to support in their ecommerce storefront. Localization supports every aspect of the platform, including product details, CMS pages, themes, and more.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-07-04\\_at\\_12.39.00\\_PM.png)\n\n### Gift Cards\n\n#### Medusa\n\nMedusa supports adding Gift Cards out-of-the-box. Merchants can specify multiple denominations and images. Customers are then able to purchase the gift card similar to how they would purchase any product, but the fulfillment of gift cards is handled differently.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-07-04\\_at\\_12.41.27\\_PM.png)\n\n#### Magento\n\nThis feature is not available in the open source version of Magento. It is only available either through Adobe Commerce or through community and paid modules.\n\n### Taxes\n\n#### Medusa\n\nIn Medusa, taxes are available out-of-the-box. Merchants can manage the taxes of regions separately and add multiple tax rates.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-07-04\\_at\\_1.57.31\\_PM.png)\n\nAdditionally, tax rates can include overrides to apply the taxes to specific products. In addition, Medusa’s Tax API allows developers to integrate third-party services for advanced tax features.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-07-04\\_at\\_1.57.10\\_PM.png)\n\n#### Magento\n\nMagento also provides tax features out-of-the-box. Merchants can specify tax rules and apply them to specific zones. Using modules, developers can also integrate third-party services for advanced tax settings.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-07-04\\_at\\_1.49.36\\_PM.png)\n\nMerchants can specify the tax class of a product or customer which is associated with tax rules. This allows them to override the tax rate applied for specific products.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-07-04\\_at\\_1.50.28\\_PM.png)\n\n### Payment and Shipping Providers\n\nBoth Medusa and Magento allow businesses and developers to integrate third-party payment and shipping providers. Also, both platforms allow customizing which payment and shipping providers are available for different regions or stores.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-07-04\\_at\\_2.01.33\\_PM.png)\n\nWhen it comes to ready-made add-ons to integrate payment and shipping providers, Magento has a wider variety of available add-ons. There’s an existing paid or free modules available for almost any payment and shipping provider worldwide.\n\nWith Medusa, developers can integrate popular and widely used providers such as Stripe, PayPal, and WebShipping with ready-made plugins. Developers can also create a plugin to integrate any other provider.\n\n### Admin Dashboard\n\n#### Medusa\n\nMedusa provides a very intuitive and easy-to-use admin dashboard. The dashboard allows merchants to manage products, orders, price lists, discounts, settings, and much more. The dashboard uses navigation layers that ensure merchants aren’t lost in between pages and can still have a full view of the entire dashboard at all times.\n\nThe admin dashboard is built with Gatsby, a static site generator. This makes the admin dashboard fast and allows merchants to browse and perform daily operations without complications.\n\n![](/images/admin-gif.gif)\n\n#### Magento\n\nMagento provides a powerful admin dashboard full of advanced features. On this dashboard, merchants can switch between store views to edit data related to a specific store, manage global settings, manage users with ACL support, and more.\n\nHowever, many of the features are missed by merchants as there are so many layers in the dashboard. Furthermore, due to Magento's architecture and the languages it’s built with, the admin dashboard is slow, slowing down daily operations within an ecommerce store.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Recording\\_2022-07-04\\_at\\_2.08.18\\_PM.gif)\n\n### Reporting\n\n#### Medusa\n\nAt the moment of writing this article, Medusa does not provide any analytics or reporting on its admin dashboard. However, developers can integrate third-party services to add reporting features.\n\n#### Magento\n\nMagento adds a variety of reports on the admin dashboard, with charts and data related to most viewed products, orders, new customers, abandoned carts, and more.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-07-04\\_at\\_2.17.14\\_PM.png)\n\n### Speed\n\n#### Medusa\n\nMedusa’s headless architecture means that the backend and frontend are decoupled. With both the frontend and backend free from the restrictions imposed by the other, they’re both much lighter and faster compared to a tightly knit architecture.\n\nFurthermore, Medusa provides 2 starter storefronts built with static-site generators (SSG) [Next.js](https://docs.medusajs.com/starters/nextjs-medusa-starter) and [Gatsby](https://docs.medusajs.com/starters/gatsby-medusa-starter). With these modern technologies, businesses are guaranteed a highly performant and fast storefront.\n\n![](/images/LcAsi8r_\\(1\\).gif)\n\n#### Magento\n\nOn the other hand, Magento stores are known to be slow. This is due to the framework’s monolithic architecture that binds the backend, frontend, and admin dashboard all in one installation and hosting.\n\nFurthermore, Magento is not easy to use with modern technologies. When building a theme for a Magento store, developers will have to use languages and libraries such as PHP and Knockout.js. To incorporate more modern technologies for a better user experience, developers need to use workarounds that are limiting.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Recording\\_2022-07-04\\_at\\_2.57.00\\_PM.gif)\n\nAlternatively, developers can use Magento’s new project [PWA Studio](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/pwa-studio/) for a faster storefront. However, it’s still under development and less mature than Magento’s default themes.\n\n## Comparison of Developer Experience\n\n### Required Developer Level\n\n#### Medusa\n\nMedusa’s architecture makes it generally an easy-to-use-and-learn platform for developers. Developers only need to have knowledge of JavaScript as the backend is built with Node.js.\n\nIn addition, the storefront and admin dashboard provided by Medusa are built with JavaScript-based frameworks. Developers also have the freedom to build the storefront and admin with any language or framework of their choice. All they have to do is connect to the backend using the [REST APIs](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store/auth).\n\nThe decoupled nature of the platform gives developers a clearer understanding of where different development tasks or components are performed.\n\n#### Magento\n\nOn the other hand, Magento is a framework that requires developers to have advanced and deep knowledge of the programming languages used for development as well as Magento’s architecture.\n\nMagento is built with PHP. A good understanding of PHP is generally enough to perform different development tasks such as building modules. However, developers often need to work with libraries like [Knockout.js](https://knockoutjs.com/) and [Less](https://lesscss.org/) when developing themes.\n\nAs for Magento’s architecture, it is composed of different layouts, blocks, modules, plugins, controllers, blocks, and editable CMS, among other components and layers. This makes the platform more customizable and gives developers and merchants the ability to customize their store based on their business need, but it can take some time to fully understand this architecture and how it all works together.\n\n### Installation Process\n\n#### Medusa\n\nMedusa’s [quickstart guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start) allows developers to create and run an ecommerce store in 3 steps: install Medusa’s CLI tool with NPM, create the medusa server using the CLI tool, and run the server.\n\nWith these 3 steps, developers will have a store with all the advanced features mentioned earlier. This ecommerce store uses an SQLite database to store the data and a fake Redis instance which will not dispatch events on the server.\n\nFor a production ecommerce store or for advanced development, it’s recommended to install and configure [PostgreSQL](https://docs.medusajs.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment#postgresql) for the store’s database and [Redis](https://docs.medusajs.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment#redis) to handle events in the server. Medusa’s documentation on how to install these tools includes steps for all major operating systems, making the process easier for developers to get started.\n\n#### Magento\n\nMagento isn’t easy to set up and install. Before developers can start with the quickstart guide, they have to follow a [prerequisites task list](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/prereq/prereq-overview.html) that requires installing tools such as MySQL, Apache, and Elasticsearch.\n\nAfter following the prerequisites task list, developers can get started with the [quickstart guide](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/composer.html). However, the quickstart guide can be somewhat confusing if a developer is not familiar with server-related concepts.\n\nA big drawback of these guides is that they only include steps specific to Linux-based systems. If a developer is using a different operating system, they’ll find it troublesome to understand how to get started with Magento.\n\n### Customization\n\n#### Medusa\n\nMedusa aims to fix issues developers run into when customizing traditional monolithic ecommerce platforms. With Medusa, there’s no need for hacks and workarounds to tailor the platform to a business’s use case.\n\nThe backend abstracts functionalities into API layers that are extendable. Developers can extend these APIs to integrate third-party services or add custom features hassle-free. Adding integrations or custom features is as easy as creating a JavaScript file that is automatically loaded into Medusa when the server is run.\n\nFurthermore, Medusa’s headless architecture allows for the ultimate customization capabilities when building the storefront of an ecommerce store. Developers can either use the existing starter storefronts or build their own with any frontend framework of their choice. The same goes for the admin dashboard.\n\n#### Magento\n\nMagento provides a lot of customization capabilities to its core, theme, and admin dashboard. Developers can override classes and files from the core in a custom module, run functions before or after a specific method in a particular class, and more.\n\nHowever, the customization process in Magento is slow and difficult. Developers need to recompile the PHP classes or the theme’s static assets whenever they make any change. This slows down the development process and the rollout of new features.\n\n### Deployment and Upgrades\n\n#### Medusa\n\nMedusa can be deployed on any cloud hosting. The deployment process is similar to the quickstart process. So, the steps are minimal.\n\nFurthermore, Medusa provides in its documentation different guides on how to deploy the platform on different platforms such as [Qovery](https://docs.medusajs.com/deployments/server/deploying-on-qovery) and [Heroku](https://docs.medusajs.com/deployments/server/deploying-on-heroku), with a button to directly deploy a Medusa server into Heroku.\n\nUpgrading Medusa is as simple as upgrading the core packages with NPM to the latest version. Some versions require running migration scripts or additional actions, and Medusa provides the [necessary documentation for these versions](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/upgrade-guides/) with the steps required to upgrade.\n\nAlternatively, if you don’t want to take care of the deployment and upgrade processes, Medusa offers a managed services solution to take care of your hosting starting at 89$. You can learn more about the managed services on [Medusa’s website](https://medusajs.com/pricing).\n\n#### Magento\n\nMagento does not provide deployment guides specific to any cloud hosting. Magento has [Pipeline Deployment documentation](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/config-guide/deployment/) that is advanced and [Single Machine Deployment documentation](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/config-guide/deployment/single-machine.html) with simpler steps.\n\nSimilar to the installation process, the deployment process requires an advanced backend developer with in-depth technical knowledge of how a server works.\n\nUpgrading Magento is not an easy process either. Many versions have upgrade guides with the steps you need to take, but some developers find it difficult to go through them or face problems during the upgrade process.\n\nThe best hosting option for Magento would probably be using Adobe Commerce which is the paid version of Magento. To get official pricing, you’ll need to [contact Adobe directly](https://business.adobe.com/products/magento/pricing.html). However, [some estimates online](https://www.magestore.com/blog/magento-pricing-true-cost-of-magento-website/) indicate that hosting ranges from $500 to $6500 per year.\n\n### Community\n\n#### Medusa\n\nAs an open source platform, Medusa focuses on building a transparent and collaborative relationship with the community. Developers can join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/medusajs) to receive help from the rest of the community and the core Medusa team and stay updated with everything related to the platform. Response time is usually immediate within the Need Help channel.\n\nAdditionally, developers can report bugs, contribute to issues, and join discussions to further improve the platform on [Medusa’s GitHub repository](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa).\n\n#### Magento\n\nMagento has a [community forum](https://community.magento.com/) where developers can send questions to receive help if they run into issues. The forum also includes announcements, events organization, and general discussions to further interact with the community.\n\nSimilarly, developers can report bugs and contribute to issues on [Magento’s GitHub repository](https://github.com/magento/magento2). Magento also has a [contributor’s leaderboard](https://magento.biterg.io/app/kibana#/dashboard/41dc0c60-fa06-11eb-bbaa-dd6ca6f8fda8) to showcase their top contributors\n\n## Conclusion\n\n### When to Use Medusa\n\nMedusa is a good choice for developers looking for a Node.js ecommerce platform.\n\nIn addition, Businesses of all sizes can use Medusa. There are no limitations or requirements that can stop a business of any size from using Medusa. Medusa is currently being used by everything from fresh new startups to businesses with +100 mUSD GMV annually.\n\nMoreover, Medusa is a good choice for businesses with custom use cases such as businesses with subscription models or multi-vendor use cases. The flexibility that Medusa provides both merchants and developers makes it a platform that can fit any use case.\n\n### When to Use Magento\n\nMagento is a good choice for developers who are more familiar with PHP.\n\nFurthermore, it’s important to take into account the business size. For smaller businesses, Magento can become too big of a platform that slows down the business operation unnecessarily.\n\nFor larger enterprise clients, Magento has the benefit of being a well-known framework that many specialized agencies support. However, the complexity of the platform also requires more specialized developers to maintain and manage it.\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/announcement-8m-usd-seed-round-to-build-the-leading-ecom-platform-for-devs.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/announcement-8m-usd-seed-round-to-build-the-leading-ecom-platform-for-devs.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/announcement-8m-usd-seed-round-to-build-the-leading-ecom-platform-for-devs.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Announcement: Medusa's $8M USD Seed Round","date":"2022-07-15","excerpt":"Medusa raises $8M Seed round to build the leading e-commerce platform for developers","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/seedround.png","altText":"Announcement: Medusa's $8M USD Seed round","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"seo_description":"Medusa raises $8M Seed round to build the leading e-commerce platform for developers","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-a9wemp4po.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json"},"name":"Other","type":"Category"},"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-x7i0ls6ji.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-x7i0ls6ji.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-x7i0ls6ji.json"},"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Rindom","image":{"url":"/images/Seb.jpeg","altText":"Person photo"},"type":"Person"}],"markdown_content":"*Read the *[*TechCrunch article*](https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/15/medusa-shopify-open-source-e-commerce-javascript-developers/)* and *[*BusinessWire article*](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220715005035/en/Medusa-Raises-8m-to-Build-the-Leading-E-Commerce-Platform-for-Developers)*.*\n\nToday, we are proud to announce our Seed round led by LocalGlobe and Dawn Capital with participation from 20 amazing founders and operators. With the fundraise we will continue building the most powerful digital commerce platform for developers and merchants while expanding partnerships and collaborations with agencies and 3rd parties.\n\nWe have long referred to ourselves as “the open source Shopify alternative” and we are often asked how Medusa differentiates from other platforms like Shopify. The answer is that, unlike other platforms that focus on merchants, Medusa’s goal is to provide developers with the best tools for creating digital commerce applications. This doesn’t mean that we don’t keep the merchant in mind when building our product, but rather that we believe that developers will play an important role in creating the customizations and improvements necessary for the next wave of e-commerce companies to be successful.\n\nOur architecture is based on abstractions to different areas of an e-commerce application, for example, payments, fulfillment, order management, etc. What you fill into those abstractions is up to you; you can use our defaults which give you core functionality similar to Shopify, but as business needs evolve within an area of your stack you can switch out our default and either modify the logic to fit your needs or integrate with a 3rd party tool. This gives you full control of a best-in-class composable commerce stack, instead of forcing you to build hacky workarounds as other platforms do.\n\nSince our launch last year we have reached more than 12,000 stars on GitHub, been joined by more than 2,000 amazing e-commerce developers on Discord, and seen more than 10,000 new Medusa projects being started. Furthermore, companies, from ambitious start-ups to enterprises, have adopted Medusa, with many already using it in production.\n\nWith the Seed round, we will be building even more amazing features into Medusa before beginning development on Medusa v2.0. On the roadmap, we have things like advanced APIs for product and order management, CMS and CRM plugin interfaces, multi-warehouse support, and much more. At the same time, we will be strengthening the developer experience to make it simpler and more intuitive to extend and customize Medusa.\n\nFurthermore, we will actively be building integrations and plugins to popular third-party tools to make it even easier to get started with a composable commerce architecture.

Founded in 2021, Palmes already sells in over 40 countries around the world. Palmes was looking for a solution that allows them to sell globally while creating an on-brand customer experience. With Medusa, Palmes is able to fulfill their vision and sell their unique products across the world.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Recording\\_2022-06-28\\_at\\_5.10.00\\_PM.gif)\n\n\n\n## Palmes Success Story\n\n*   Took less than six weeks to go from Design to a live store leveraging the Gatsby starter.\n*   Palmes started selling in over 40 countries and with 4 different currencies from the start of their online store.\n*   Today, more than two-thirds of their ecommerce revenue is generated outside its home market.\n*   Fully brand-tailored design and user experience on their storefront.\n\n## The Challenge\n\n*   Sell across the globe and in multiple currencies without the need to manage multiple stores or dashboards.\n*   Create a unique user experience relevant to the brand’s products and vision.\n*   Use a scalable platform that allowed them to switch out or add integrations as their business grew.\n\n## The Solution: Medusa\n\n*   Full tech-stack ownership since Medusa is an open-source solution.\n*   Multi-currency and regional support. Palmes sells in +40 markets with 4 currencies at the moment.\n*   Fully automated RMA flows for order returns, claims, and exchanges, allowing Palmes to provide good customer service.\n*   Medusa’s ready-made plugins for third-party tools and services such as Contentful, Stripe, MeiliSearch, and more.\n*   Full storefront customization to implement their custom design and experience.\n*   Include all necessary and basic ecommerce features to provide a better customer experience such as customer accounts, regions, and currencies based on automatic location detection, full checkout flow, and much more.\n\n## The Story\n\nStarting from 2020 when it was founded, Palmes provides day-to-day tennis attire and accessories. When Palmes decided to start selling online, they wanted a platform that provides them with the flexibility to create their unique vision without limitations.\n\nAfter investigating other platforms to find a solution that would give them all the features they needed, they chose Medusa as it gives them all these features and more.\n\n### Multi-Region and Currency Support\n\nUsing Medusa, Palmes were able to cater to countries across the globe from the start. Using Medusa’s multi-region and multi-currency features, Palmes were able to add as many regions as they wanted with currencies specific to those regions.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Recording\\_2022-06-27\\_at\\_6.15.07\\_PM.gif)\n\n\n\nUnlike most ecommerce platforms, Medusa provides businesses with full flexibility over the pricing of their products for each currency. Palmes is not limited to a defined conversion rate or a price format when they add their products.\n\n### On-Brand and Unique Storefront\n\nDue to Medusa’s composable architecture, Palmes was able to create a unique user experience on their storefront that was complementary to their brand identity. You can see it in their net design for sold-out product variants or when you open your cart.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-06-27\\_at\\_6.19.47\\_PM.png)\n\n\n\nThe decoupling of the frontend and backend means the frontend is highly performant without a heavy backend slowing it down. As the storefront is built with Gatsby, a static-site generator, the storefront is blazingly fast providing users with a seamless shopping experience.\n\n[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/) websites built with frameworks like Gatsby offer more security, scalability, and a higher performance. These are essential for every ecommerce storefront, and Palmes are able to utilize that due to Medusa’s architecture.\n\n### Optimized Checkout Experience with Integrations\n\nPalmes also used Medusa’s plugins to add payment providers specific for different regions. Currently, Palmes uses Medusa’s Stripe, Klarna, and PayPal plugins. The variety of payment providers allows customers to choose the payment provider most preferable for them in their region.\n\nUsing these integrations and the Jamstack frontend allows them to deliver an optimized checkout flow that helps users place orders with the providers available for their regions.\n\nWith a solution like Medusa, Palmes can choose to add integrations or features in the future without any limitations. Medusa is a highly extendable platform that is capable of scaling with businesses as they grow.\n\n### Intuitive Admin Dashboard to Manage it All\n\nWhen it comes to managing their online store and configurations, Medusa’s admin dashboard offers an intuitive design and experience. This admin dashboard allows Palmes to manage their orders, returns, products, and much more all from a single platform.\n\n![](/images/Untitled-2a45406f.png)\n\n\n\nThis is immensely beneficial when it came to supporting +40 countries regions and currencies, as they don’t have to manage the products, prices, orders, and other settings and data for each market from different dashboards.\n\n## Get Started with Medusa\n\nIf you’re interested in getting started with Medusa and creating your own success story, check out our [Quickstart](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start) guide to get set up in minutes.\n\nMedusa is an open-source ecommerce platform with a growing community behind it.

Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\n[Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) is a rising ecommerce platform that fits all businesses. Medusa is an open source composable ecommerce platform with easy customizations and integrations. Medusa comes with a lot of [ecommerce features](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#features) that provide flexibility to both merchants and developers.\n\nHaving a headless architecture, Medusa’s frontend and backend are decoupled. This gives developers the freedom to choose what frontend framework or tool they use to build their storefront.\n\nOne option is using the [Vue Storefront UI](https://docs.storefrontui.io/?path=/docs/welcome--page). It provides out-of-the-box customizable and performance-oriented components. You can use them in a Nuxt.js project to build stunning modern online stores.\n\nIn this article, you’ll learn how to use Vue Storefront UI to build a storefront for your Medusa server. You can find the full code of the storefront on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Rose-stack/Vue-js-storefront-with-a-Medusa-Server).\n\n![](/images/Screen_Recording\\_2022-06-29\\_at\\_12.29.31\\_PM.gif)\n\n## **Prerequisites**\n\nTo follow along with this guide, it's essential to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine with at least version 14.\n\n## **Set Up the Medusa Server**\n\nTo create the Medusa server, you need the Medusa CLI tool. Run the following command to install it:\n\n```\nnpm install @medusajs/medusa-cli -g\n```\n\nThen, run the following command to create the Medusa server:\n\n```\nmedusa new local-medusa-server --seed\n```\n\nThe `--seed` command populates an SQLite database with some test data once the setup is done.\n\nThen, change to the newly created directory and start your medusa server:\n\n```\ncd local-medusa-server \u0026\u0026 medusa develop\n```\n\nTo test if the server is working, open `http://localhost:9000/store/products` in your browser. You should get a similar response as below:\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-06-29\\_at\\_12.35.35\\_PM.png)\n\nFinally, it’s recommended to install a storage plugin to add products. You can use [MinIO](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/minio), [S3](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/s3), or [Spaces](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/spaces).\n\n## Install Medusa Admin\n\nMedusa provides a prebuilt [admin dashboard](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/quickstart) that assists you in configuring and managing the products you have in your store. However, this is a complete optionally set up that you can choose to use in this tutorial.\n\nTo install the Medusa admin, open a new directory and run the following command:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/medusajs/admin medusa-admin\n```\n\nOnce the installation process is done, change to the newly created directory `medusa-admin` and install the dependencies with NPM:\n\n```\ncd medusa-admin \u0026\u0026 npm install\n```\n\nMake sure the Medusa server is still running. Then, run the Medusa admin with the following command:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nYou can now access Medusa admin on `http://localhost:7000/`. If you seeded your database with demo data using the `--seed` option when you created your Medusa admin, you can log in using the email `admin@medusa-test.com` and password `supersecret`. Otherwise, you can use the `[user` command provided by the Medusa CLI tool]\\(https://docs.medusajs.com/cli/reference#user).\n\nAfter logging in, navigate to the Products menu. You can add a few products from here by clicking on “New Product” at the top right.\n\n![](/images/products.jpg)\n\nIn the form, you can specify many information related to the product such as name, handle, description, weight, and more.\n\n![](/images/edit-products.jpg)\n\nTo learn more about the features in the [](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/quickstart/)Medusa admin, check out the [documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/quickstart/).\n\n## **Setting up the Nuxt.js Storefront**\n\nIn a different directory than the previous directories, run the following command to create a Nuxt.js website:\n\n```\nnpx create-nuxt-app nuxtjs-storefront\n```\n\nYou’ll be asked a few questions. You can answer as instructed in the image below:\n\n![](/images/nuxt-app-config.png)\n\nFeel free to change the package manager to either NPM or Yarn based on your preference.\n\nWhen the installation process is done, proceed to the newly created folder:\n\n```\ncd nuxtjs-storefront\n```\n\n### **Connect the Vue Storefront to the Medusa Server**\n\nTo start off, you need to install the [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) package. Axios is an HTTP package for making requests. Axios will process the requests between the Medusa server and the Storefront.\n\nRun the following command to install it in the `nuxtjs-storefront` directory:\n\n```\nnpm i -s axios\n```\n\nAfter the installation is done, you need to configure the Nuxt.js storefront to use the `8000` port. This is because the Medusa server uses CORS to ensure only defined hosts access the server and the default port expected for the storefront is `8000`. You can learn more about it in [Medusa’s documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/usage/configurations#storefront-cors).\n\nAdd the following line after the `ssr` key in the `nuxt.config.js` file:\n\n```\nexport default {\n  ssr: false,\n  server: {\n    port: 8000\n  },\n\t//...\n}\n```\n\nNext, you need to add the URL to the Medusa server as an environment variable.\n\nStart by installing the `dotenv` module:\n\n```\nnpm install @nuxtjs/dotenv\n```\n\nThen, register the installed `dotenv` module in`nuxt.config.js` file in the `buildModules` array:\n\n```\nbuildModules: [\n    '@nuxtjs/dotenv'\n],\n```\n\nFinally, create a `.env` file at the root of your project directory and add your server URL as an environment variable:\n\n```\nbaseUrl=http://localhost:9000\n```\n\n### Install Vue Storefront UI\n\nThis tutorial uses [Vue Storefront UI](https://docs.storefrontui.io/?path=/docs/getting-started-installation--page). This means you don’t have to create components from scratch and can use the ready-made components provided by Vue Storefront UI.\n\nIn the `nuxtjs-storefront` directory, run the following command to install Vue Storefront UI:\n\n```\nnpm install --save @storefront-ui/vue\n```\n\n## **Set up components and layout**\n\nThe Vue app will have the following components:\n\n*   **Navbar**: Used to display the logo and links in the header of the website\n*   **ProductCard**: Used to display short information about the product.\n*   **Footer**: Used to display helpful links to customers.\n\n### Create **the Navbar component**\n\nTo create the Navbar component, create a file at `components/App/Navbar.vue` with the following content:\n\n```\n\u003ctemplate\u003e\n  \u003cSfHeader :logo=\"shopLogo\" :title=\"shopName\" active-icon=\"account\"\u003e\n    \u003ctemplate #navigation\u003e\n      \u003cSfHeaderNavigationItemv v-for=\"(category, key) in navbarLinks\" :key=\"`sf-header-navigation-item-${key}`\"\n        :link=\"`${category.link}`\" :label=\"category.title\" /\u003e\n    \u003c/template\u003e\n  \u003c/SfHeader\u003e\n\u003c/template\u003e\n\u003cscript\u003e\n  import {\n    SfHeader\n  } from \"@storefront-ui/vue\";\n  export default {\n    name: \"Default\",\n    components: {\n      SfHeader,\n    },\n    data() {\n      return {\n        shopName: \"My Storefront App\",\n\t\t\t\tshopLogo: \"/logo.svg\",\n        navbarLinks: [{\n          title: \"Products\",\n          link: \"/\",\n        }, ],\n      };\n    },\n  };\n\n\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nThis is a basic component that defines the navigation of your page. The Vue Storefront UI provides a [SfHeader](https://docs.storefrontui.io/?path=/docs/components-organisms-header--common) component. Inside that component, you can add other internal navigation components such as `SfHeaderNavigation` and `SfHeaderNavigationItem`.\n\nYou can also pass the component props to customize it such as the title, logo, or icons in the navigation bar.\n\nMake sure you add the `logo.svg` file to be displayed in the navigation bar. The logo should be added to the `static` folder. If your logo has a different name, ensure you change that in the `shopLogo` property in the `data` function.\n\n### Create **the Footer component**\n\nNext, create the `components/App/Footer.vue` file with the following content:\n\n```\n\u003ctemplate\u003e\n  \u003cSfFooter\u003e\n    \u003cSfFooterColumn v-for=\"(column, key) in footerColumns\" :key=\"key\" :title=\"column.title\"\u003e\n      \u003cSfList\u003e\n        \u003cSfListItem v-for=\"(menuItem, index) in column.items\" :key=\"index\"\u003e\n          \u003cSfMenuItem :label=\"menuItem\" /\u003e\n        \u003c/SfListItem\u003e\n      \u003c/SfList\u003e\n    \u003c/SfFooterColumn\u003e\n  \u003c/SfFooter\u003e\n\u003c/template\u003e\n\u003cscript\u003e\n  import {\n    SfFooter,\n    SfList,\n    SfMenuItem\n  } from \"@storefront-ui/vue\";\n  export default {\n    name: \"Default\",\n    components: {\n      SfFooter,\n      SfList,\n      SfMenuItem,\n    },\n    data() {\n      return {\n        footerColumns: [{\n            title: \"About us\",\n            items: [\"Who we are\", \"Quality in the details\", \"Customer Reviews\"],\n          },\n          {\n            title: \"Departments\",\n            items: [\"Women fashion\", \"Men fashion\", \"Kidswear\", \"Home\"],\n          },\n          {\n            title: \"Help\",\n            items: [\"Customer service\", \"Size guide\", \"Contact us\"],\n          },\n          {\n            title: \"Payment \u0026 delivery\",\n            items: [\"Purchase terms\", \"Guarantee\"],\n          },\n        ],\n      };\n    },\n  };\n\n\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nThe Footer component just includes helpful links for your customer. The Vue Storefront UI library provides a predefined UI for footers using the [SfFooter](https://docs.storefrontui.io/?path=/docs/components-organisms-footer--common) component.\n\n### Create **the ProductCard component**\n\nCreate the `components/ProductCard.vue` file with the following content:\n\n```\n\u003ctemplate\u003e\n  \u003cSfProductCard :image=\"item.thumbnail\" :imageWidth=\"216\" :imageHeight=\"326\" badgeLabel=\"\" badgeColor=\"\"\n    :title=\"item.title\" :link=\"this.url\" :linkTag=\"item.id\" :scoreRating=\"4\" :reviewsCount=\"7\" :maxRating=\"5\"\n    :regularPrice=\"this.highestPrice.amount\" :specialPrice=\"this.lowestPrice.amount\" wishlistIcon=\"heart\"\n    isInWishlistIcon=\"heart_fill\" :isInWishlist=\"false\" showAddToCartButton :isAddedToCart=\"false\"\n    :addToCartDisabled=\"false\" /\u003e\n\u003c/template\u003e\n```\n\nThe product card uses the [SfProductCard](https://docs.storefrontui.io/?path=/docs/components-organisms-productcard--common) component provided by Vue Storefront UI to display a short summary of a product’s information including the title, price, and thumbnail.\n\nThen, in the same file, add the following at the end of the file:\n\n```\n\u003cscript\u003e\nimport { SfProductCard } from \"@storefront-ui/vue\"; // Import the components\nexport default {\n    name:\"ProductCard\",\n    components:{\n        SfProductCard\n    },\n    props: {\n        item: {\n            type: Object,\n        }\n    },\n    computed:{\n        url(){\n            return `/products/${this.item.id}`; // Product page\n        },\n        lowestPrice() {\n        // Get the lowest price from the list of prices.\n        const lowestPrice = this.item.variants.reduce(\n            (acc, curr) =\u003e {\n            return curr.prices.reduce((lowest, current) =\u003e {\n                if (lowest.amount \u003e current.amount) {\n                return current;\n                }\n                return lowest;\n            });\n            },\n            { amount: 0 }\n        );\n        // Format the amount and also add currency\n        return {\n            amount:\n            lowestPrice.amount \u003e 0\n                ? (lowestPrice.amount / 100).toLocaleString(\"en-US\", {\n                    style: \"currency\",\n                    currency: \"USD\",\n                })\n                : 0,\n            currency_code: \"USD\",\n        };\n        },\n        highestPrice() {\n        // Get the highest price from the list of prices\n        const highestPrice = this.item.variants.reduce(\n            (acc, curr) =\u003e {\n            return curr.prices.reduce((highest, current) =\u003e {\n                if (highest.amount \u003c current.amount) {\n                return current;\n                }\n                return highest;\n            });\n            },\n            { amount: 0 }\n        );\n\n        // Format the amount and also add currency\n        return {\n            amount:\n            highestPrice.amount \u003e 0\n                ? (highestPrice.amount / 100).toLocaleString(\"en-US\", {\n                    style: \"currency\",\n                    currency: \"USD\",\n                })\n                : 0,\n            currency_code: \"USD\",\n        };\n        },\n    }\n\n}\n\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nThis script prepares the data to be displayed by the template. That includes formatting the price and URL of the component.\n\n### Create **the Storefront Layout**\n\nTo set up the layout, create the file `layouts/default.vue` with the following content:\n\n```\n\u003ctemplate\u003e\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003capp-navbar /\u003e\n    \u003cmain\u003e\n      \u003cdiv class=\"container\"\u003e\n        \u003cNuxt /\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/main\u003e\n    \u003capp-footer /\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/template\u003e\n\u003cscript\u003e\n  import \"@storefront-ui/vue/styles.scss\"; // vuestorefront UI styles.\n  export default {\n    name: 'DefaultLayout'\n  }\n\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nThis will display the page with the [default Vue Storefront UI layout](https://docs.storefrontui.io/?path=/docs/layouts-default--default-story).\n\n## Create Home Page\n\nUnder the `pages` directory, edit the `index.vue` file to the following:\n\n```\n\u003ctemplate\u003e\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"row\"\u003e\n      \u003cdiv class=\"col-md-12\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003cSfHero class=\"hero\" :slider-options=\"{ autoplay: false }\"\u003e\n          \u003cSfHeroItem\n            v-for=\"(img, index) in heroes\"\n            :key=\"index\"\n            :title=\"img.title\"\n            :subtitle=\"img.subtitle\"\n            :button-text=\"img.buttonText\"\n            :background=\"img.background\"\n            :class=\"img.className\"\n          /\u003e\n        \u003c/SfHero\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv class=\"col-md-12\"\u003e\n        \u003ch4 class=\"text-center mt-5 mb-5\"\u003eAll Products\u003c/h4\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv v-if=\"products.length\"\u003e\n      \u003cdiv class=\"row\"\u003e\n        \u003cProductCard v-for=\"product in products\" :key=\"product.id\" :item=\"product\" /\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/template\u003e\n\n\u003cscript\u003e\nimport Axios from 'axios';\nimport { SfHero } from \"@storefront-ui/vue\";\nexport default {\nname: 'ProductsIndex',\ncomponents: {\n    SfHero,\n  },\n    data () {\n    return {\n    products: [],\n\t\theroes: [\n        {\n          title: \"Colorful T-shirts already in store\",\n          subtitle: \"JUNE COLLECTION 2022\",\n          buttonText: \"Learn more\",\n          background: \"rgb(236, 239, 241)\",\n        },\n        {\n          title: \"Colorful Sweatshirts already in store\",\n          subtitle: \"JUNE COLLECTION 2022\",\n          buttonText: \"Learn more\",\n          background: \"rgb(239, 235, 233)\",\n        },\n        {\n          title: \"Colorful Sweatpants already in store\",\n          subtitle: \"JUNE COLLECTION 2022\",\n          buttonText: \"Learn more\",\n          background: \"rgb(236, 239, 241)\",\n        },\n      ],\n    }\n},\nasync fetch(){ // Fetching the products from Medusa server\n        try{\n        const {data:{products}} = await Axios.get(`${process.env.baseUrl}/store/products`);\n        this.products = products\n        }catch(e){\n        console.log('An error occured', e)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nThis fetches products from the Medusa server using Axios and displays them using the `ProductCard` component you created earlier.\n\nYou also add a carousel using the [SfHero](https://docs.storefrontui.io/?path=/docs/components-organisms-hero--common) component. It shows an automatic slider with buttons and text. Each slide is defined as a `SfHeroItem` component.\n\n### Test Home Page\n\nTo test out the home page, make sure the Medusa server is running and start the Nuxt.js development server:\n\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nThen, open `http://localhost:8000` in a browser, you should see the home page with a carousel, products, and a footer.\n\n![](/images/screencapture-localhost-8000-2022-06-29-13\\_58\\_13.png)\n\n## Create a Single Product Page\n\nIn this section, you’ll create a single product page to display more details of a product.\n\nTo create a single product page, Create the file `pages/products/_id.vue` with the following content:\n\n```\n\u003ctemplate\u003e\n  \u003cdiv id=\"product\"\u003e\n    \u003cSfBreadcrumbs class=\"breadcrumbs desktop-only\" :breadcrumbs=\"breadcrumbs\" /\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003cp v-if=\"$fetchState.pending\"\u003eFetching Data...\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp v-else-if=\"$fetchState.error\"\u003eAn error occurred :(\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cdiv v-else class=\"product\"\u003e\n      \u003cSfGallery :images=\"this.getImages\" class=\"product__gallery\" :image-width=\"422\" :image-height=\"664\"\n        :thumb-width=\"160\" :thumb-height=\"160\" :enableZoom=\"true\"/\u003e\n      \u003cdiv class=\"product__info\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv class=\"product__header\"\u003e\n          \u003cSfHeading :title=\"product.title\" :level=\"1\" class=\"sf-heading--no-underline sf-heading--left\" /\u003e\n          \u003cSfIcon icon=\"drag\" size=\"42px\" color=\"#E0E0E1\" class=\"product__drag-icon smartphone-only\" /\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cdiv class=\"product__price-and-rating\"\u003e\n          \u003cSfPrice :regular=\"this.lowestPrice.amount\" /\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n          \u003cp class=\"product__description desktop-only\"\u003e{{ this.product.description }}\n          \u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003cSfAddToCart v-model=\"qty\" class=\"product__add-to-cart\" @click=\"addToCart\" /\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003ctransition name=\"slide\"\u003e\n      \u003cSfNotification class=\"notification desktop-only\" type=\"success\" :visible=\"isOpenNotification\"\n        :message=\"`${qty} ${product.title} has been added to CART`\" @click:close=\"isOpenNotification = true\"\u003e\n        \u003ctemplate #icon\u003e\n          \u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/template\u003e\u003c/SfNotification\u003e\n    \u003c/transition\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/template\u003e\n```\n\nThis page displays the following components from the Vue Storefront UI library:\n\n*   [SfBreadcrumbs](https://docs.storefrontui.io/?path=/docs/components-atoms-breadcrumbs--common) - Displays the path to the current product.\n*   [SfGallery](https://docs.storefrontui.io/?path=/docs/components-molecules-gallery--common) - Arranges product images that users can browse through with zoom-in functionality. Alternatively, you can use [Carousel navigation](https://docs.storefrontui.io/?path=/docs/components-organisms-carousel--common) to organize your product images.\n*   [SfHeading](https://docs.storefrontui.io/?path=/docs/components-atoms-heading--common)  - Displays product titles and can have an optional description.\n*   [SfPrice](https://docs.storefrontui.io/?path=/docs/components-atoms-price--common) - Display the product’s price.\n*   [SfAddToCart](https://docs.storefrontui.io/?path=/docs/components-molecules-addtocart--common) - Displays Add to Cart button with quantity options.\n*   [SfNotification](https://docs.storefrontui.io/?path=/docs/components-molecules-notification--common) - Displays notification at the bottom of the page that indicates the items are added to the cart. This component is only used to simulate adding a product to the cart but this is not covered in this tutorial.\n\nNext, add the following at the end of the same file:\n\n```\n\u003cscript\u003e\n  import { // UI components\n    SfGallery,\n    SfHeading,\n    SfPrice,\n    SfIcon,\n    SfAddToCart,\n    SfBreadcrumbs,\n    SfNotification,\n  } from \"@storefront-ui/vue\";\n  import Axios from \"axios\";\n  export default {\n    name: \"Product\",\n    components: {\n      SfGallery,\n      SfHeading,\n      SfPrice,\n      SfIcon,\n      SfAddToCart,\n      SfBreadcrumbs,\n      SfNotification,\n    },\n    data() { // default data\n      return {\n        current: 1,\n        qty: 1,\n        selected: false,\n        product: {\n          name: \"\",\n          title: \"\",\n          description: \"\",\n          images: [],\n          price: {\n            regular: 0,\n          },\n        },\n        breadcrumbs: [{\n          text: \"Home\",\n          link: \"/\",\n        }, ],\n        isOpenNotification: false,\n      };\n    },\n    computed: {\n      getImages() { // Format Product images in a way that the component understands.\n        return this.product ?\n          this.product.images.map((image) =\u003e {\n            return {\n              mobile: {\n                url: image.url,\n              },\n              desktop: {\n                url: image.url,\n              },\n              big: {\n                url: image.url,\n              },\n              alt: this.product?.title,\n              name: this.product?.title,\n            };\n          }) :\n          [];\n      },\n      lowestPrice() {\n        // Get the least price\n        const lowestPrice = this.product.variants ?\n          this.product.variants.reduce(\n            (acc, curr) =\u003e {\n              return curr.prices.reduce((lowest, current) =\u003e {\n                if (lowest.amount \u003e current.amount) {\n                  return current;\n                }\n                return lowest;\n              });\n            }, {\n              amount: 0\n            }\n          ) :\n         {\n            amount: 0\n          };\n        // Format the amount and append the currency.\n        return {\n          amount: lowestPrice.amount \u003e 0 ?\n            (lowestPrice.amount / 100).toLocaleString(\"en-US\", {\n              style: \"currency\",\n              currency: \"USD\",\n            }) :\n            0,\n          currency: \"USD\",\n        };\n      },\n    },\n    methods: {\n      addToCart() {\n        this.isOpenNotification = true;

Then, go to `localhost:8000` and click on a product on the home page. You’ll be redirected to the product’s page with more information about it.\n\nIf you click the Add to Cart button, you’ll see a notification at the bottom of the page indicating you added the product to the cart. As mentioned earlier, this is only used for simulation and does not actually add the product to the cart.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Recording\\_2022-06-29\\_at\\_1.55.41\\_PM.gif)\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThis tutorial only scratches the surface of what you can do with Medusa and Vue Storefront UI.\n\nWith Medusa, you can implement other ecommerce features in your storefront such:\n\n*   [Cart functionalities and features](https://docs.medusajs.com/guides/carts-in-medusa).

Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\n[Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) is the leading open source Node.js ecommerce platform for JavaScript developers. It provides similar core functionality as Shopify out-of-the-box, while its open abstraction-based and headless architecture makes customizations and maintenance much easier to handle for developers as businesses’ needs evolve.\n\nMost of the heavy lifting job has been done by Medusa so that you can achieve a production-ready store in a short amount of time. Medusa’s abstract architecture also allows developers to extend and customize the platform to fit their use case hassle-free.\n\nThis article will take you through Medusa’s architecture and give you a general overview of the Medusa server to better understand how it works.\n\n## Medusa Architecture Overview\n\n![](/images/Untitled-1de61030.png)\n\nThree main components of a Medusa project\n\nMedusa’s complete architecture consists of three main components: Headless Node.js Ecommerce Server, Admin Dashboard, and Storefront. The modular and headless architecture makes all three components completely separated and deployable to different environments without any restriction.\n\nTo understand more what each component is:\n\n1.  Medusa Server (Headless)\n    *   This is the core component and is the brain of your online store. It is a Node.js Ecommerce Server. Being a **headless server**, it is accessed via REST APIs. Both the storefront and admin dashboard are presentation layers to interact with the server.\n    *   Everything you configure in the admin dashboard or actions performed by consumers on the storefront are handled underneath by the Medusa server.\n2.  Admin Dashboard\n    *   Only authorized personnel can access the admin dashboard. This is where you manage your online store’s data and settings such as adding products, setting price/currencies, and managing orders.\n    *   Medusa provides an [intuitive admin built with Gatsby](https://github.com/medusajs/admin), but you can also create your own from scratch using the [REST APIs](https://docs.medusajs.com).\n3.  Storefront\n    *   A storefront is where consumers arrive, search for products and buy them. An example of a storefront is the Amazon website. You can either have one cross-platform storefront (e.g., web application), or multiple storefronts (e.g., web, iOS, and Android native applications).\n    *   Medusa provides two starter storefronts, one built using [Next.js](https://github.com/medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa) and one using [Gatsby](https://github.com/medusajs/gatsby-starter-medusa). You can also build your own storefront by interacting with the [REST APIs](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store/auth).\n\nThis article focuses only on the Medusa server, as it is the core of your Node.js ecommerce platform.\n\n## Development Environment\n\nMedusa relies mainly on Node.js to be installed on your system. You need version 14 or higher.\n\nMedusa also uses other technologies and tools such as PostgreSQL and Redis.\n\nThis article covers how and when these components are used in your Medusa server. You can follow along [this documentation to learn how to install each of the environment requirements](https://docs.medusajs.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment/).\n\n## How to install the Medusa server?\n\nTo install the Medusa server, you need to use the Medusa CLI tool. You can install the Medusa CLI tool with the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install -g @medusajs/medusa-cli\n```\n\nThen, install a Medusa server with the following command\n\n```\nmedusa new my-medusa-store --seed\n```\n\nYour server now resides in the `my-medusa-store` folder. The `--seed` option creates an SQLite database in the root of the project. The SQLite database holds dummy data for your server such as sample products, regions, and more. Seeded data is only for testing purposes in a development environment.\n\nAs using the SQLite database can present a lot of limitations in development and especially in production, it is recommended to [install and set up a PostgreSQL database](https://docs.medusajs.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment#postgresql) instead.\n\n## What is `my-medusa-store` made of?\n\nIf you have worked with *NestJS* or *Angular* before, the folder structure might seem familiar. Navigate to `my-medusa-store`, and you can see the content below.\n\n![](/images/Untitled%201-cf35f3b4.png)\n\nInside my-medusa-store folder\n\nFor starters, the four main directories and files you want to focus on are `data`, `dist`, `src`, and `medusa-config.js`.\n\n1.  `data` directory contains fake data to populate your demo store either using the `--seed` option or using the command `npm run seed`.\n2.  `medusa-config.js` file is where you define project configuration, such as database information, service API keys, plugins, and more.\n3.  `src` folder holds the implementation of your custom files, from custom endpoints (in `api`) to global services (in `services`) and event listeners (in `subscribers`). These three child folders are going to be discussed in the next few sections.\n4.  `dist` directory only appears after you run `npm run build` or `medusa develop`. It holds compiled files that are originally in the `src` directory. The compiled files will be used when you run the server.\n\nFor product image uploads you need to install and integrate file service plugins such as [MinIO](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/minio), [Amazon S3](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/s3), or [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/spaces).\n\n## What is in the medusa-config.js file?\n\nBy default, the server contains the following variables.\n\n### ADMIN_CORS and STORE_CORS\n\nThe components are decoupled in Medusa. So, the Node.js ecommerce headless server, admin dashboard, and storefront can have different origins (e.g., different domains, or different ports on the same domain). This causes [Avoid Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) and blocks communication between components.\n\nThe usage of CORS variables is a way to solve this issue. By default, the headless server runs on port `9000`, the admin dashboard runs on port `7000` or `7001`, and the storefront is available at port `8000`. If you decide to change the origins of the front ends or deploy components to different environments, then the CORS values must be adjusted accordingly.\n\n```\n# .env\n# CORS when consuming Medusa from admin\nADMIN_CORS=http://localhost:7000\n\n# CORS to avoid issues when consuming Medusa from a client\nSTORE_CORS=http://localhost:8000\n```\n\n### DATABASE_URL\n\nThis is a connection string to the PostgreSQL instance.\n\nPostgreSQL is a mature open source relational database that has been adopted by developers around the world. With its performance, reliability, and strict data integrity, PostgreSQL can support your online store even on a global scale.\n\nFor connection string construction, please refer to [PostgreSQL official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING).\n\n```\n# .env\n# Sample of typical PostgreSQL connection string format\n# postgres://\u003cDB_USER\u003e:\u003cPASSWORD\u003e@\u003cHOST\u003e:\u003cPORT_NUMBER\u003e/\u003cDB_NAME\u003e\nDATABASE_URL=postgres://adminuser:password123@localhost:5432/my-medusa-database \n```\n\n### REDIS_URL\n\nThis is a connection string to the Redis instance.\n\nRedis is a high-performant open source in-memory data structure. In Medusa, it is used as an event queue, so all events-related features need Redis to be properly configured. More about how Medusa uses Redis is explained later in this guide.\n\nFor connection string, please refer to [this guide](https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/wiki/Redis-URI-and-connection-details).\n\n```\n# .env\n# Sample of typical Redis connection string format\n# redis://\u003cREDIS_USER\u003e:\u003cPASSWORD\u003e@\u003cHOST\u003e:\u003cPORT_NUMBER\u003e/\u003cINSTANCE_NAME\u003e\nREDIS_URL=redis://superuser:redispassword@localhost:6379/my-redis-instance\n```\n\n### Plugins\n\nIn many ecommerce solutions, extending the functionalities often requires a dedicated team and server resources. However, Medusa solves this by letting you incorporate new features to the core server process via plugins; thereby eliminating additional resource requirements.\n\nSince Medusa is a Node.js ecommerce platform, a plugin is basically an NPM package. After installation, put the name of your plugin (package) in the `plugins` variable and you are good to go. From here on out, the plugins can use all other Medusa services and even access the database.\n\n```\nconst plugins = [\n  `plugin-without-options`,\n  {\n    resolve: `plugin-with-options`,\n    options: {\n      api_key: YOUR_PLUGIN_API_KEY,\n      ...\n    },\n  },\n];\n```\n\n## How to run the Medusa server?\n\nUse the following command in the root of the Medusa server directory to run the server:\n\n```\nmedusa develop\n```\n\nThe server will run on`localhost:9000`. You can check the [API reference](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store/auth/) for a list of endpoints you can use to interact with the server.\n\n## What is a custom endpoint in Medusa?\n\nLet’s say you want to allow a business partner to access your inventory, what is the way to do so? Certainly, a protected API is the answer for you.\n\nIn the Medusa server, you can implement custom endpoints in the `/src/api` folder. As Express is used internally, in a sense, the Medusa instance can act as a general public Express server. There is no limit to the endpoints. Your endpoints can be organized into one, or multiple files.\n\nBy conventions, endpoints for admin are prefixed with `admin`, while endpoints for storefront are prefixed with `store`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n/** \n * /src/api/index.js \n */\n\nimport { Router } from \"express\"\n\nexport default () =\u003e {\n  const router = Router()\n\n  router.get(\"/admin/hello\", (req, res) =\u003e {\n    res.json({\n      message: \"Welcome to Your Store!\",\n    })\n  })\n\n  return router\n}\n```\n\nImplementation of APIs requires a certain degree of Express knowledge and is not discussed in this article. To dive deeper into endpoints in Medusa, check out the documentation on [how to create endpoints](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/endpoints/create).\n\n## What is a Service in Medusa?\n\nNow that you know the Medusa server can create custom endpoints, let's revisit the B2B example:\n\n\u003e You want to have a business partner accessing your inventory.\n\nAs stated, a protected API is required so only your partner can access the private inventory, and you know where the API is implemented, but where does the \"private inventory access\" feature reside?\n\nFollowing the [SOLID principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) where an S represents **single responsibility**, files in `/src/api` are controllers responsible for managing HTTP requests/responses and deciding what portion of the code should be called upon.\n\nOn the other hand, *private inventory access* is considered a service. Services in Medusa reside in `/src/services`. They represent one specific entity and functionalities related to it.\n\nAn example of a service:\n\n```\n/** \n * /src/services/privateInventoryAccess.js \n */\n\nimport { BaseService } from \"medusa-interfaces\"\n\nclass PrivateInventoryAccessService extends BaseService {\n  getUnreleasedProducts() {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\nexport default PrivateInventoryAccessService\n```\n\nServices can be accessed anywhere on your Medusa server. For example, to use `PrivateInventoryAccessService` in an endpoint:\n\n```\n/** \n * /src/api/index.js \n */\n\n// File name of service is \"privateInventoryAccess.js\", so its registration name\n//  is a camel-cased version: \"privateInventoryAccessService\"\n// The service is accessible via req.scope.resolve(serviceRegistrationName)\nconst privateInventoryAccessService = req.scope.resolve(\"privateInventoryAccessService\")\n\nres.json({\n  unreleasedProducts: privateInventoryAccessService.getUnreleasedProducts(),\n})\n```\n\nFor a complete tutorial on service creation, you can start with [official Medusa documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/services/create-service).\n\n## What is a Subscriber in Medusa?\n\nMedusa handles some specific but fundamental actions of a Node.js ecommerce platform such as order placement or user password reset. When an action happens, a respective event is emitted (for example, order placement emits an `order.placed` event).\n\nA subscriber is responsible for listening to these events and handling them. Internally, events rely on [the Redis event queue](https://redis.com/redis-best-practices/communication-patterns/event-queue/). Events are pushed to this queue, then Redis will emit these events to the subscribers that are listening to them.\n\nWithout Redis being installed and configured, events are not emitted and subscribers will not work. [You can download Redis at their official website.](https://redis.io/download/)\n\nYou can achieve highly customizable workflows using subscribers. Many plugins such as [SendGrid](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/sendgrid/) or [Mailchimp](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/mailchimp) use subscribers internally, and you can use them as a plug-and-play workflow extension.\n\nYou can check out the [full list of events in Medusa’s documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/subscribers/events-list/).\n\nCustomized subscribers reside in `/src/subscribers`. Here’s an example of a subscriber:\n\n```\n/**\n * /src/subscribers/orderPlacementLogger.js\n */\n\nclass OrderPlacementLoggerSubscriber {\n  constructor({ eventBusService }) {\n    eventBusService.subscribe(\"order.placed\", this.writeLog);\n  }\n\n  writeLog = async (data) =\u003e {\n    console.log(...)\n  };\n}\n\nexport default OrderPlacementLoggerSubscriber;\n```\n\nFor a complete tutorial on subscribers and how they work check out [Medusa’s documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/services/create-service/).\n\n## Next Steps\n\nThis article should help you have a grasp of the Medusa server fundamentals.

Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\n[React Native](https://reactnative.dev) is a cross-platform mobile app framework that allows you to build native apps for iOS and Android using JavaScript. It was developed by Meta Platforms, Inc. and it is currently among the most popular JavaScript frameworks for building native apps with a huge active community behind it.\n\n[Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) is an open source headless commerce platform that allows you to create online shopping stores in a few minutes. It includes every feature a store needs such as order management, customers, payments, products, discounts, and a lot more.\n\nIn this tutorial, you are building a React Native mobile commerce application with Medusa. For this part, you are going to create two screens, one for all products and the other for the product info.\n\nYou can also find the source code of the React Native app on the [**GitHub**](https://github.com/suhailkakar/react-native-medusajs/tree/part-1)\n\n![](/images/Screen-Recording-2022-05-05-at-1.gif)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore you start with the tutorial make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v14 or greater installed on your machine.\n\n## Set Up Medusa Server\n\nThe first step is to setup the Medusa server, where the backend and APIs are handled.\n\nYou can install the Medusa CLI on your machine by running the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install -g @medusajs/medusa-cli\n```\n\nOnce the CLI is installed successfully, run the following command to create a Medusa project:\n\n```\nmedusa new my-medusa-store --seed\n```\n\nThe `--seed` option is used to add dummy data such as products and users to the store.\n\nChange to the newly-created directory `my-medusa-store` and run the following command to start the medusa server:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nIt is recommended to add a storage plugin to be able to add products with images in Medusa. You can use [**MinIO**](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/minio), [**AWS S3**](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/s3/), or [**Spaces**](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/spaces/).\n\n## Set Up Medusa Admin\n\nMedusa has a very powerful admin dashboard where you can manage your products, payments, transaction, and more. This is very easy to setup however it is optional, so if you want you can skip this section.\n\nIn a separate directory, clone the Medusa Admin:\n\n```\n git clone https://github.com/medusajs/admin medusa-admin\n```\n\nOnce it is cloned, you should see a new directory named `medusa-admin`. Navigate to the new directory and run the following command to install the dependencies of the project:\n\n```\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Run Admin** **Panel\n\nFinally, make sure that the Medusa server is still running and start the admin panel server by running the following command:\n\n```\nnpm run develop\n```\n\nNow, open your browser and navigate to `localhost:7000` and you should see the login page for admin panel. Login in to the admin with the below credentials.\n\n*   Email: [**admin@medusa-test.com**](mailto:admin@medusa-test.com)\n*   Password: supersecret\n\n\u003e The `--seed` option you used earlier adds an admin user with the email and password\n\n### Create Products\n\nOnce you are logged in successfully, choose Products from sidebar and you should see the list of products in your store.\n\n\u003e If you are experiencing connection issues, it's most likely because of CORS issues. Check [here](https://docs.medusajs.com/troubleshooting/cors-issues) how to fix it.\n\n![](/images/CNtujb5ve.png)\n\nYou can also create a new product by clicking on the \"New Product\" button. Add information for your product such as a name, description, handle, variants, images, prices, and a lot more.\n\n![](/images/lDe6wdWg6.png)\n\n## Set Up React Native Ecommerce Project\n\nNow that you have the store backend and admin panel ready it is time to start working on the react native ecommerce app.\n\nIn this tutorial, you are using Expo CLI to build the app. Run the following command to install the Expo CLI:\n\n```\nnpm install -g expo-cli\n```\n\nOnce the CLI is installed successfully, run the following command to create a new react native ecommerce project:\n\n```\nexpo init\n```\n\nYou will be promoted with some questions. You can follow the below code for the answers:\n\n```\nWhat would you like to name your app? … medusa-store\nChoose a template: › blank a minimal app as clean as an empty canvas\nDownloaded template.\n\n🧶 Using Yarn to install packages. Pass --npm to use npm instead.\nInstalled JavaScript dependencies.\n\n✅ Your project is ready!\n\nTo run your project, navigate to the directory and run one of the following yarn commands.\n\n- cd medusa-store\n- yarn start # you can open iOS, Android, or web from here, or run them directly with the commands below.\n- yarn android\n- yarn ios\n- yarn web\n```\n\n### Install Dependencies\n\nOnce the project is created successfully you should see a new directory named `medusa-store`. Navigate to the new directory and run the following command to install a few other dependencies:\n\n```\nexpo install react-native-screens react-native-router-flux react-native-reanimated rn-responsive-screen react-native-safe-area-context @expo/vector-icons react-native-gesture-handler axios\n```\n\n*   `react-native-screens` is used to expose native navigation container components to React Native.\n*   `react-native-router-flux` provides API that helps users navigate between screens.\n*   `react-native-reanimated` creates smooth animations and interactions that run on the UI thread.\n*   `rn-responsive-screen` is a small package used for responsiveness in the app.\n*   `react-native-safe-area-context` is a flexible way to handle safe areas.\n*   `react-native-gesture-handler` provides native-driven gesture management APIs for building the best possible touch-based experiences.\n*   `axios` is a promise-based HTTP Client to easily send requests to REST APIs and perform CRUD operations.\n*   `@expo/vector-icons` includes popular icons sets which you can use in the app.\n\n### Run Expo Development Server\n\nAfter the packages are installed successfully, start the development server by running the following:\n\n```\nexpo start\n```\n\nYou can either scan the QR code using your device or run the app on an Android/iOS simulator. Once the app is shown on your mobile, you should see a similar screen.\n\n![](/images/T_VjUvvQY.png)\n\nThis is a basic react native code in the `App.js` file.\n\n### Set Up Routes\n\nIn this section, you’ll set up different routes in your app.\n\nBefore setting up the routes, you have to create a few screens. Create a new folder named `screens` and inside it create a new file named `Products.js`.\n\nInside `Products.js` insert the following code:\n\n```\nimport { StyleSheet, Text, View } from \"react-native\";\n\nexport default function Products() {\n  return (\n    \u003cView style={styles.container}\u003e\n      \u003cText\u003eProduct Screen!\u003c/Text\u003e\n    \u003c/View\u003e\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    backgroundColor: \"#fff\",\n    alignItems: \"center\",\n    justifyContent: \"center\",\n  },\n});\n```\n\nFor now it contains a very simple `Text` component.\n\nNow that you have a screen setup, you can continue to add routes to the project. Replace the code inside of the `App.js` with the following:\n\n```\nimport { Router, Scene, Stack } from \"react-native-router-flux\";\nimport Products from \"./screens/Products\";\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    \u003cRouter\u003e\n      \u003cStack key=\"root\"\u003e\n        \u003cScene key=\"products\" component={Products} hideNavBar /\u003e\n      \u003c/Stack\u003e\n    \u003c/Router\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn the above code, you are using `react-native-router-flux` to create the navigation. `Router` is used as a parent component and each `Scene` represents one screen. For now you have just one screen.\n\nSave the file and you might see an error similar to this.\n\n```\nError: Requiring module \"node_modules/react-native-reanimated/src/Animated.js\", which threw an exception: Error: Reanimated 2 failed to create a worklet, maybe you forgot to add Reanimated's babel plugin?\n```\n\nIt is because that `react-native-router-flux` uses `react-native-reanimated` and in order to make it work you need to add it to `babel.config.js`. Open the babel file from your directory and add the below line after `presents`:\n\n```\nplugins: [\"react-native-reanimated/plugin\"],\n```\n\nSave the file and restart the server with the following command:\n\n```\nexpo start -c\n```\n\nThe option `-c` clears the cache before running the server.\n\n\u003e If you see the error “Invariant Violation: Tried to register two views with the same name RNGestureHandlerButton”, delete the `node_modules` directory and use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to re-install the dependencies.\n\n### Products List Screen\n\nCreate a new folder in the root directory named `components`. In the `components` folder create 3 files. `Button.js`, `ProductCard.js`, and `Header.js`.\n\nIn the `Button.js` file insert the following code to create a basic button component:\n\n```\nimport { View, Text, StyleSheet } from \"react-native\";\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { widthToDp } from \"rn-responsive-screen\";\n\nexport default function Button({ title, onPress, style, textSize }) {\n  return (\n    \u003cView style={[styles.container, style]}\u003e\n      \u003cText\n        style={[styles.text, { fontSize: textSize ? textSize : widthToDp(3.5) }, ]}\n        onPress={onPress}\n      \u003e\n        {title}\n      \u003c/Text\u003e\n    \u003c/View\u003e\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    backgroundColor: \"#C37AFF\",\n    padding: 5,\n    width: widthToDp(20),\n    alignItems: \"center\",\n    justifyContent: \"center\",\n    borderRadius: 59,\n  },\n  text: {\n    color: \"#fff\",\n    fontWeight: \"bold\",\n  },\n});\n```\n\nSimilarly in the `Header.js` insert the following code to create a simple header component:\n\n```\nimport { View, Image, StyleSheet, Text } from \"react-native\";\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nexport default function Header({ title }) {\n  return (\n    \u003cView style={styles.container}\u003e\n      \u003cImage\n        source={{\n          uri: \"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7554214/153162406-bf8fd16f-aa98-4604-b87b-e13ab4baf604.png\",\n        }}\n        style={styles.logo}\n      /\u003e\n      \u003cText style={styles.title}\u003e{title}\u003c/Text\u003e\n    \u003c/View\u003e\n  );\n}\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flexDirection: \"row\",\n    justifyContent: \"space-between\",\n    alignItems: \"center\",\n    marginBottom: 10,\n  },\n  title: {\n    fontSize: 20,\n    fontWeight: \"500\",\n  },\n  logo: {\n    width: 50,\n    height: 50,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nThe last one is `ProductCard.js`. It is the main component in which you render the product data:\n\n```\nimport { View, Text, Image, StyleSheet } from \"react-native\";\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { widthToDp, heightToDp } from \"rn-responsive-screen\";\nimport Button from \"./Button\";\n\nexport default function ProductCard({ key, product }) {\n  return (\n    \u003cView style={styles.container} key={key}\u003e\n      \u003cImage\n        source={{\n          uri: product.thumbnail,\n        }}\n        style={styles.image}\n      /\u003e\n      \u003cText style={styles.title}\u003e{product.title}\u003c/Text\u003e\n      \u003cText style={styles.category}\u003e{product.handle}\u003c/Text\u003e\n      \u003cView style={styles.priceContainer}\u003e\n        \u003cText style={styles.price}\u003e\n          ${product.variants[0].prices[1].amount / 100}\n        \u003c/Text\u003e\n\n        \u003cButton\n          title=\"BUY\"\n        /\u003e\n      \u003c/View\u003e\n    \u003c/View\u003e\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    shadowColor: \"#000\",\n    borderRadius: 10,\n    marginBottom: heightToDp(4),\n    shadowOffset: {\n      width: 2,\n      height: 5,\n    },\n    shadowOpacity: 0.25,\n    shadowRadius: 6.84,\n    elevation: 5,\n    padding: 10,\n    width: widthToDp(42),\n    backgroundColor: \"#fff\",\n  },\n  image: {\n    height: heightToDp(40),\n    borderRadius: 7,\n    marginBottom: heightToDp(2),\n  },\n  title: {\n    fontSize: widthToDp(3.7),\n    fontWeight: \"bold\",\n  },\n  priceContainer: {\n    flexDirection: \"row\",\n    justifyContent: \"space-between\",\n    alignItems: \"center\",\n    marginTop: heightToDp(3),\n  },\n  category: {\n    fontSize: widthToDp(3.4),\n    color: \"#828282\",\n    marginTop: 3,\n  },\n  price: {\n    fontSize: widthToDp(4),\n    fontWeight: \"bold\",\n  },\n});\n```\n\n\u003e In the above code, the product price is divided by 100 because in Medusa the prices are hosted on the server without decimals.\n\n### Create URL Constant\n\nCreate a new folder named `constants` and inside it create a new file named `url.js` with the following content:\n\n```\nconst baseURL = \"http://127.0.0.1:9000\";\n\nexport default baseURL;\n```\n\nIn the above code, you define your Medusa server’s base URL. To be able to connect from your device to the local server, you must change the value of `baseURL` to your machine’s IP address. You can refer to [this guide](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-local-ip-address) to learn how to find your IP address.\n\n### Products Screen\n\nThat’s it for the components. Now replace the code in the `Products.js` with the following:\n\n```\nimport { ScrollView, StyleSheet,TouchableOpacity, View } from \"react-native\";\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from \"react\";\nimport ProductCard from \"../components/ProductCard\";\nimport { widthToDp } from \"rn-responsive-screen\";\nimport axios from \"axios\";\nimport Header from \"../components/Header\";\nimport { Actions } from \"react-native-router-flux\";\nimport baseURL from \"../constants/url\";\n\nexport default function Products() {\n  const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);\n\n  function fetchProducts() {\n\t\taxios.get(`${baseURL}/store/products`).then((res) =\u003e {\n      setProducts(res.data.products);\n    }); \n }\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    fetchProducts();\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    \u003cView style={styles.container}\u003e\n      \u003cHeader title=\"Medusa's Store\" /\u003e\n      \u003cScrollView\u003e\n        \u003cView style={styles.products}\u003e\n          {products.map((product) =\u003e (\n            \u003cProductCard key={product.id} product={product} /\u003e\n          ))}\n        \u003c/View\u003e\n      \u003c/ScrollView\u003e\n    \u003c/View\u003e\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    paddingTop: 50,\n    backgroundColor: \"#fff\",\n    alignItems: \"center\",\n    justifyContent: \"center\",\n  },\n  products: {\n    flex: 1,\n    flexDirection: \"row\",\n    flexWrap: \"wrap\",\n    width: widthToDp(100),\n    paddingHorizontal: widthToDp(4),\n    justifyContent: \"space-between\",\n  },\n});\n```\n\nIn the code above, you call `fetchProducts` when the screen loads using `useEffect`. In the `fetchProducts` function, you use `axios` to fetch the [products from the Medusa server](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store/product/list-products) and save it in the state.\n\nOnce you fetch the products, you render them using the `ProductCard` component.\n\n### Run the App\n\nSave the file and make sure that Expo and the Medusa server are running. Then, open the app on your device and you should see on the home screen the products from your Medusa server.\n\n![](/images/Untitled.png)\n\n### Product Info Screen\n\nIn this section, you’ll create the Product Info screen where the user can see more details about the product.\n\nIn the `screens` directory, create a new file named `ProductInfo.js` and for now you can use it to render a simple `Text` component:\n\n```\nimport { View, Text } from \"react-native\";\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nexport default function ProductInfo() {\n  return (\n    \u003cView\u003e\n      \u003cText\u003eProduct Info Screen\u003c/Text\u003e\n    \u003c/View\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThen, add the import `ProductInfo` at the top of `App.js`:\n\n```\nimport ProductInfo from \"./screens/ProductInfo\";\n```\n\nAnd add a new `Scene` component below the existing `Scene` component in the returned JSX:\n\n```\n\u003cScene key=\"ProductInfo\" component={ProductInfo} hideNavBar /\u003e\n```\n\nIn the `components` directory, create a new directory named `ProductInfo` and create inside it `Image.js` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { View, TouchableOpacity, Image, StyleSheet } from \"react-native\";\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from \"react\";\nimport { widthToDp } from \"rn-responsive-screen\";\n\nexport default function Images({ images }) {\n  const [activeImage, setActiveImage] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    setActiveImage(images[0].url);\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    \u003cView style={styles.imageContainer}\u003e\n      \u003cImage source={{ uri: activeImage }} style={styles.image} /\u003e\n      \u003cView style={styles.previewContainer}\u003e\n        {images.map((image, index) =\u003e (\n          \u003cTouchableOpacity\n            key={index}\n            onPress={() =\u003e {\n              setActiveImage(image.url);\n            }}\n          \u003e\n            \u003cImage\n              source={{ uri: image.url }}\n              style={[\n                styles.imagePreview,\n                {\n                  borderWidth: activeImage === image.url ? 3 : 0,\n                },\n              ]}\n            /\u003e\n          \u003c/TouchableOpacity\u003e\n        ))}\n      \u003c/View\u003e\n    \u003c/View\u003e\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  image: {\n    width: widthToDp(100),\n    height: widthToDp(100),\n  },\n  previewContainer: {\n    flexDirection: \"row\",\n    justifyContent: \"center\",\n    alignItems: \"center\",\n    marginTop: widthToDp(-10),\n  },\n  imageContainer: {\n    backgroundColor: \"#F7F6FB\",\n    paddingBottom: widthToDp(10),\n  },\n  imagePreview: {\n    width: widthToDp(15),\n    marginRight: widthToDp(5),\n    borderColor: \"#C37AFF\",\n    borderRadius: 10,\n    height: widthToDp(15),\n  },\n});\n```\n\nIn the above component you display a main big image and below it the rest of the product images as thumbnails. When the user press on one of the thumbnail images it is set as the active image and displayed as the main image.\n\nIn the `Products.js` file, replace the map function in the returned JSX with the following:\n\n```\n{products.map((product) =\u003e (\n    \u003cTouchableOpacity key={product.id} onPress={() =\u003e Actions.ProductInfo({ productId: product.id })}\u003e\n      \u003cProductCard product={product} /\u003e\n    \u003c/TouchableOpacity\u003e\n  ))\n}\n```\n\nYou add a `TouchableOpacity` that navigates the user to the product info screen when they click on a product.\n\n\u003e Using `react-router-flux` you pass the product ID from the home screen to the product info screen.\n\nThen, replace the code in `ProductInfo.js` with the following:\n\n```\nimport { View, Text, ScrollView,TouchableOpacity, StyleSheet } from \"react-native\";\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport axios from \"axios\";\nimport { SafeAreaView } from \"react-native-safe-area-context\";\nimport Images from \"../components/ProductInfo/Image\";\nimport baseURL from \"../constants/url\";\nimport { Actions } from \"react-native-router-flux\";\nimport { Ionicons } from \"@expo/vector-icons\";\n\nexport default function ProductInfo({ productId }) {\n  const [productInfo, setproductInfo] = useState(null);\n\n\tuseEffect(() =\u003e {\n    axios.get(`${baseURL}/store/products/${productId}`).then((res) =\u003e {\n      setproductInfo(res.data.product);\n    });\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    \u003cSafeAreaView style={styles.container}\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cTouchableOpacity onPress={() =\u003e Actions.pop()}\u003e\n        \u003cIonicons\n          style={styles.icon}\n          name=\"arrow-back-outline\"\n          size={24}\n          color=\"black\"\n        /\u003e\n      \u003c/TouchableOpacity\u003e\n      \u003cScrollView\u003e\n        {productInfo \u0026\u0026 (\n          \u003cView\u003e\n            \u003cImages images={productInfo.images} /\u003e\n          \u003c/View\u003e\n        )}\n      \u003c/ScrollView\u003e\n    \u003c/SafeAreaView\u003e\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\ncontainer: {\n    flex: 1,\n    backgroundColor: \"#fff\",\n    justifyContent: \"center\",\n  },\n  icon: {\n    marginLeft: 10,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nTo briefly explain the code snippet:\n\n*   First you import all necessary components.\n*   Then you fetch the product data in useEffect function and save it in the state.\n*   Finally, you display the images using the `Images` component.\n\n### Test Product Info Screen\n\nOpen the app now and click on any product on the home screen. A new screen will open showing the product’s images.\n\n![](/images/NwGh1xt9_.png)\n\nNow, you’ll display the product’s information.\n\nIn the `components` folder, inside the `ProductInfo` directory create a new file named `MetaInfo.js` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { View, Text, StyleSheet } from \"react-native\";\nimport React, { useState } from \"react\";\nimport { height, heightToDp } from \"rn-responsive-screen\";\n\nexport default function MetaInfo({ product }) {\n  const [activeSize, setActiveSize] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    \u003cView style={styles.container}\u003e\n      \u003cView style={styles.row}\u003e\n        \u003cText style={styles.title}\u003e{product.title}\u003c/Text\u003e\n        \u003cView\u003e\n          \u003cText style={styles.price}\u003e\n            ${product.variants[0].prices[1].amount / 100}\n          \u003c/Text\u003e\n          \u003cText style={styles.star}\u003e⭐⭐⭐\u003c/Text\u003e\n        \u003c/View\u003e\n      \u003c/View\u003e\n      \u003cText style={styles.heading}\u003eAvailable Sizes\u003c/Text\u003e\n      \u003cView style={styles.row}\u003e\n        {product.options[0].values.map((size, index) =\u003e (\n          \u003cText\n            onPress={() =\u003e {\n              setActiveSize(index);\n            }}\n            style={[\n              styles.sizeTag,\n              {\n                borderWidth: activeSize === index ? 3 : 0,\n              },\n            ]}\n          \u003e\n            {size.value}\n          \u003c/Text\u003e\n        ))}\n      \u003c/View\u003e\n      \u003cText style={styles.heading}\u003eDescription\u003c/Text\u003e\n      \u003cText style={styles.description}\u003e{product.description}\u003c/Text\u003e\n    \u003c/View\u003e\n  );\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    marginTop: heightToDp(-5),\n    backgroundColor: \"#fff\",\n    borderTopLeftRadius: 20,\n    borderTopRightRadius: 20,\n    height: heightToDp(50),\n    padding: heightToDp(5),\n  },\n  title: {\n    fontSize: heightToDp(6),\n    fontWeight: \"bold\",\n  },\n  row: {\n    flexDirection: \"row\",\n    justifyContent: \"space-between\",\n    alignItems: \"center\",\n  },\n  price: {\n    fontSize: heightToDp(5),\n    fontWeight: \"bold\",\n    color: \"#C37AFF\",\n  },\n  heading: {\n    fontSize: heightToDp(5),\n    marginTop: heightToDp(3),\n  },\n  star: {\n    fontSize: heightToDp(3),\n    marginTop: heightToDp(1),\n  },\n  sizeTag: {\n    borderColor: \"#C37AFF\",\n    backgroundColor: \"#F7F6FB\",\n    color: \"#000\",\n    paddingHorizontal: heightToDp(7),\n    paddingVertical: heightToDp(2),\n    borderRadius: heightToDp(2),\n    marginTop: heightToDp(2),\n    overflow: \"hidden\",\n    fontSize: heightToDp(4),\n    marginBottom: heightToDp(2),\n  },\n  description: {\n    fontSize: heightToDp(4),\n    color: \"#aaa\",\n    marginTop: heightToDp(2),\n  },\n});\n```\n\nIn the above component, you render the product title, price, description and variants.\n\nFor the product variant, you map all the variants and when a user press on one of them, you set that variant as active.\n\nSave the `MetaInfo.js` file and import it at the top of `screens/ProductInfo.js`:\n\n```\nimport MetaInfo from \"../components/ProductInfo/MetaInfo\";\n```\n\nThen, in the returned JSX add the `MetaInfo` component below the `Images` component:\n\n```\n\u003cMetaInfo product={productInfo} /\u003e\n```\n\n### Test New Changes in Product Info Screen\n\nSave the changes and check the app now. The product info screen now shows details about the product.\n\n![](/images/Untitled%201.png)\n\n## **What’s Next?**\n\nThis article gives you the basis for creating a Medusa and React Native apps.

It was established in 2017 and now operates in more than 50 countries around the world. Tekla used WooCommerce for their first online store but quickly found that a more composable and headless architecture was needed to scale their e-commerce channel further. For that reason, Tekla became the first case that [Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) was built around.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-05-31\\_at\\_3.24.06\\_PM.png)\n\n\n\n## Tekla’s Success Story\n\nTekla’s success is still on a high and it’s not a finished story yet, but here are some of the highlights of their success story since migrating to Medusa:\n\n1.  Their conversion rate increased by 70% compared to the Woocommerce solution they previously worked with.\n2.  They significantly reduced their customer service response hours as they were able to fully automate their return, exchange, and claim processes.\n3.  They grew their market reach from 2 markets to over 50 markets. They were able to perform this transformation in a matter of days.\n4.  They were able to switch ERP providers in a month. This kind of project usually takes 4-8 months with other ecommerce solutions.\n\n## The Challenge\n\n*   Lack of customization of their storefront stopped them from creating the desired customer experience that aligned with the brand identity.\n*   Restrictions in their choices and ownership of their tech stack made it hard to add new features or integrations.\n*   Difficulty in adding and managing multiple regions and currencies from a single platform.\n*   Lack of automation of core customer service workflows like return, exchange, and claim management.\n*   A slow storefront that led to a bad user experience.\n\n## The Solution: Medusa\n\n*   Fully customizable headless architecture that gives them the flexibility to create a unique customer experience in the “Tekla universe”.\n*   A scalable backend to support Tekla’s growth with the ability to add new features and integrations to best-in-breed tools.\n*   A multi-regional set up to operate in multiple different markets with multiple different currencies through a single platform.\n*   Fully automated returns process starting from the self-service return form on the storefront to the creation of swaps and fulfillment of orders.\n*   A much faster Jamstack storefront that allows customers to seamlessly explore their products.\n\n## The Story\n\nBack in 2017, Tekla was struggling with its WooCommerce setup due to a lot of challenges related to its monolithic architecture, presenting them with many limitations.\n\nAfter researching different solutions, it became clear that no platforms could cater to their requirements in a way that would be easily maintainable. Among many other platforms, Shopify was evaluated but was ultimately dismissed for its inflexible proprietary nature that would be hard to maintain and scale.\n\nInstead, Medusa was chosen as a more developer-friendly alternative that would ensure Tekla’s long-term goals could be met. Tekla became Medusa’s first case.\n\n*Suggested Read: *[*The Story Behind How We Created Medusa*](https://medusajs.com/blog/open-source-ecommerce-platform/)*.*\n\nMedusa provided Tekla with everything they were looking for, allowing them to create a custom-designed storefront that would immerse their customers in the Tekla universe. Furthermore, Tekla saw incredible improvements in their storefront performance super powering the user experience of the website and ensuring better SEO scores.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-04-27\\_at\\_3.13.57\\_PM.png)\n\n\n\nTekla has created a purchasing experience that aligns with the nature of its products by integrating with [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) for rich CMS features. This enabled them to implement advanced features such as different image sets for their unisex sleepwear so that the user can change between a male or female model when browsing.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Recording\\_2022-05-31\\_at\\_4.34.31\\_PM.gif)\n\n\n\nThis integration with Contentful as well as other services is done seamlessly due to Medusa’s headless architecture and its plug-and-play integrations.\n\nWhen it comes to managing their online store and configurations, Medusa’s dashboard offers an intuitive design and experience. This admin dashboard allows Tekla to manage their orders, returns, products, and much more all from a single platform.\n\nThis is immensely beneficial when it came to supporting +50 regions and currencies, as they don’t have to manage the products, prices, orders, and other settings and data for each market from different dashboards.\n\n![](/images/image.png)\n\n\n\nMedusa’s architecture also allowed Tekla to manage the full setup with only one frontend developer as the platform has been purposefully built to be easy to maintain.\n\n## How Tekla Utilizes Medusa\n\nTekla uses Medusa as the core of its ecommerce platform. Medusa has [many features](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#features) that make it a powerful platform. Some of Medusa’s features that Tekla uses and have contributed to its success story:\n\n*   Full tech-stack ownership since Medusa is an open-source solution.\n*   Multi-currency and regional support. Tekla sells in +50 markets with 6 currencies at the moment.\n*   Medusa’s ready-made plugins for third-party tools and services such as Contentful, Stripe, PayPal, MeiliSearch, Segment, and more.\n*   Full storefront customization to implement their custom design and experience.\n*   Ability to add custom integrations and services. Some of these integrations include Zendesk for live chat and customer support on their storefront and DHL as a fulfillment provider.\n*   A fully automated RMA flow allows them to spend significantly less time handling return orders, claims, and swaps.\n*   Include all necessary and basic ecommerce features to provide a better customer experience such as customer accounts, regions, and currencies based on automatic location detection, full checkout flow, and much more.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-05-31\\_at\\_4.41.51\\_PM.png)\n\n## Get Started with Medusa\n\nIf you’re interested in getting started with Medusa and creating your own success story, check out our [Quickstart](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start) guide to get set up in minutes.\n\nMedusa is an open-source ecommerce platform with a growing community behind it.

Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\n[Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) is an open source ecommerce platform that provides developers with customizability and extendability within all of its 3 components - the headless server, the admin, and the storefront.\n\nWhether you want to add third-party integrations or custom functionalities, you have full freedom with how you implement them. Medusa is an open source ecommerce platform that comes packed with [important ecommerce features](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#features) out-of-the-box and ready-made [plugins](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/tree/master/packages) that you can install with a plug-and-play style.\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to add product reviews to your Medusa server for your online store. You’ll also customize both the Medusa admin and Next.js storefront of your online store to show the reviews, and allow customers to add their reviews to products on the storefront of your online store.\n\nYou can find the code for this ecommerce tutorial in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/shahednasser/medusa-reviews-tutorial).\n\n## **Ecommerce Platform** Prerequisites\n\nBefore you follow along with this tutorial, you must have the following requirements installed:\n\n*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v14 or greater\n*   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)\n\n## **Ecommerce** Server Setup\n\nTo install the Medusa server, you need to install the CLI tool first:\n\n```\nnpm install -g @medusajs/medusa-cli\n```\n\nThen, run the following command to install the Medusa server:\n\n```\nmedusa new medusa-reviews\n```\n\nThis installs your Medusa server into a newly-created directory `medusa-reviews`.\n\n### Configure PostgreSQL Database\n\nCreate an empty PostgreSQL database. Then, in `.env` in the root of your Medusa server directory, add the following environment variable:\n\n```\nDATABASE_URL=\u003cYOUR_DATABASE_URL\u003e\n```\n\nWhere `\u003cYOUR_DATABASE_URL\u003e` is the URL to the database schema you just created in PostgreSQL. The URL should be of the format `postgres://\u003cUSERNAME\u003e:\u003cPASSWORD\u003e@\u003cHOST\u003e/\u003cDB_NAME\u003e`. For example, `postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost/medusa-reviews`.\n\nThen, change the database configuration in the exported object in `medusa-config.js` to use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  projectConfig: {\n    //...\n    database_url: DATABASE_URL,\n    database_type: \"postgres\",\n\t\t//comment out or remove the following lines:\n    // database_database: \"./medusa-db.sql\",\n    // database_type: \"sqlite\",\n  },\n  plugins,\n};\n```\n\n### Seed and Migrate the Database\n\nFinally, run the following command to migrate Medusa’s database schema and seed it with demo data:\n\n```\nnpm run seed\n```\n\n## Add Product Reviews\n\nIn this section, you’ll add the `ProductReview` model, its associated repository, the [migration](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/migrations) to create it in the database, and the [service](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/services/create-service) to facilitate accessing and manipulating product reviews in the database from endpoints.\n\n### Create the ProductReview model\n\nBefore you create the model, install the `class-validator` library to add validation to some of the columns in the new model:\n\n```\nnpm install class-validator\n```\n\nThen, create the file `src/models/product-review.ts` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { BaseEntity, Product } from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\nimport { BeforeInsert, Column, Entity, Index, JoinColumn, ManyToOne } from \"typeorm\"\nimport { Max, Min } from \"class-validator\"\n\nimport { generateEntityId } from \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/utils\"\n\n@Entity()\nexport class ProductReview extends BaseEntity {\n\n  @Index()\n  @Column({ type: \"varchar\", nullable: true })\n  product_id: string\n\n  @ManyToOne(() =\u003e Product)\n  @JoinColumn({ name: \"product_id\" })\n  product: Product\n\n  @Column({ type: \"varchar\", nullable: false })\n  title: string\n\n  @Column({ type: \"varchar\", nullable: false })\n  user_name: string\n\n  @Column({ type: \"int\" })\n  @Min(1)\n  @Max(5)\n  rating: number\n\n  @Column({ nullable: false })\n  content: string\n\n  @BeforeInsert()\n  private beforeInsert(): void {\n    this.id = generateEntityId(this.id, \"prev\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou create a new model `ProductReview` that extends `BaseEntity` . `BaseEntity` adds 3 common columns `id`, `created_at` and `updated_at`.\n\nYou additionally add the columns `id`, `product_id`, `title`, `user_name`, `rating`, and `content`.\n\nYou also add a method to be run before inserting a new record in the database for this model which uses a utility function from Medusa. If the record doesn’t have an ID, a random and unique ID is generated for it.\n\n### Create the Repository\n\nThe next step is to create the Typeorm repository for this model. [Typeorm repositories](https://typeorm.io/repository-api) provide you an API to perform a variety of actions on tables in the database\n\nCreate the file `src/repositories/product-review.ts` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { EntityRepository, Repository } from \"typeorm\"\n\nimport { ProductReview } from \"../models/product-review\"\n\n@EntityRepository(ProductReview)\n export class ProductReviewRepository extends Repository\u003cProductReview\u003e { }\n```\n\n### Create the Migration\n\nMigrations are used to add or modify a database schema before running the server. It eliminates the need to do it manually on your RDBS each time you want to install your server.\n\nTypeorm migration filenames are prefixed with a timestamp, so you have to create your own using this command:\n\n```\nnpx typeorm migration:create -n ProductReview --dir src/migrations\n```\n\nThis will create the migration `ProductReview` in the directory `src/migrations`. You should find a file inside `src/migrations` that has a file name of the format `\u003cTIMESTAMP\u003e-ProductReview.ts`.\n\nInside the migration, there’s an `up` method and a `down` method. The `up` method is executed when you run the migration, and the `down` method is executed when you revert the migration.\n\nReplace the `up` method with the following:\n\n```\npublic async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    await queryRunner.query(\n        `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS \"product_review\" (\"id\" character varying NOT NULL, \"product_id\" character varying NOT NULL, \n        \"title\" character varying NOT NULL, \"user_name\" character varying NOT NULL,\n        \"rating\" integer NOT NULL, \"content\" character varying NOT NULL, \n        \"created_at\" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now(), \"updated_at\" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT now())`\n    )\n    await queryRunner.createPrimaryKey(\"product_review\", [\"id\"])\n    await queryRunner.createForeignKey(\"product_review\", new TableForeignKey({\n        columnNames: [\"product_id\"],\n        referencedColumnNames: [\"id\"],\n        referencedTableName: \"product\",\n        onDelete: \"CASCADE\",\n        onUpdate: \"CASCADE\"\n    }))\n}\n```\n\nThis creates the table with its columns, makes the column `id` the primary key, and adds a foreign key on the column `product_id`.\n\nThen, replace the `down` method with the following:\n\n```\npublic async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    await queryRunner.dropTable(\"product_review\", true)\n}\n```\n\nThis drops the table `product_review` if you revert the migration.\n\nBefore you can run migrations with Medusa, you need to run the `build` command to transpile the Typescript files into JavaScript files:\n\n```\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThen, run the following command to run the migrations:\n\n```\nmedusa migrations run\n```\n\nThis runs the migration you created which creates a new table `product_review` in the database for your Medusa server.\n\n### Create the Service\n\nIn this section, you’ll create the service that you’ll use in endpoints to access or add product reviews.\n\nCreate the file `src/services/product-review.js` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { BaseService } from \"medusa-interfaces\";\n\nclass ProductReviewService extends BaseService {\n  constructor({ productReviewRepository, manager }) {\n    super();\n\n    this.productReviewRepository = productReviewRepository\n    this.manager = manager\n  }\n  \n  async getProductReviews (product_id) {\n    const productReviewRepository = this.manager.getCustomRepository(this.productReviewRepository);\n    return await productReviewRepository.find({\n      product_id\n    });\n  }\n\n  async addProductReview (product_id, data) {\n    if (!data.title || !data.user_name || !data.content || !data.rating) {\n      throw new Error(\"product review requires title, user_name, content, and rating\")\n    }\n\n    const productReviewRepository = this.manager.getCustomRepository(this.productReviewRepository);\n    const createdReview = productReviewRepository.create({\n      product_id: product_id,\n      title: data.title,\n      user_name: data.user_name,\n      content: data.content,\n      rating: data.rating\n    })\n    const productReview = await productReviewRepository.save(createdReview);\n\n    return productReview\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ProductReviewService;\n```\n\nThis creates the service `ProductReviewService`. This service has 2 methods. `getProductReviews` gets all reviews for a product ID, and `addProductReview` creates a new product review for a product ID using data passed to it as a second parameter.\n\n### Create Endpoints\n\nFinally, you’ll create 3 new endpoints on your Medusa server:\n\n*   A `GET` route `/store/products/:id/reviews` to get reviews for a product on the storefront.\n*   A `POST` route `/store/products/:id/reviews` to add a new review for a product on the storefront.\n*   A `GET` route `/admin/products/:id/reviews` to get reviews on the Medusa admin.\n\nCreate the file `src/api/index.js` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { Router } from \"express\"\nimport bodyParser from \"body-parser\"\nimport cors from \"cors\"\nimport { projectConfig } from \"../../medusa-config\"\n\nexport default () =\u003e {\n  const router = Router()\n  const storeCorsOptions = {\n    origin: projectConfig.store_cors.split(\",\"),\n    credentials: true,\n  }\n\n  router.get(\"/store/products/:id/reviews\", cors(storeCorsOptions), (req, res) =\u003e {\n    const productReviewService = req.scope.resolve(\"productReviewService\")\n    productReviewService.getProductReviews(req.params.id).then((product_reviews) =\u003e {\n      return res.json({\n        product_reviews\n      })\n    })\n  })\n\n  router.use(bodyParser.json())\n  router.options(\"/store/products/:id/reviews\", cors(storeCorsOptions))\n  router.post(\"/store/products/:id/reviews\", cors(storeCorsOptions), (req, res) =\u003e {\n    const productReviewService = req.scope.resolve(\"productReviewService\")\n    productReviewService.addProductReview(req.params.id, req.body.data).then((product_review) =\u003e {\n      return res.json({\n        product_review\n      })\n    })\n  })\n\n  const corsOptions = {\n    origin: projectConfig.admin_cors.split(\",\"),\n    credentials: true,\n  }\n  router.options(\"/admin/products/:id/reviews\", cors(corsOptions))\n  router.get(\"/admin/products/:id/reviews\", cors(corsOptions), async (req, res) =\u003e {\n    const productReviewService = req.scope.resolve(\"productReviewService\")\n    productReviewService.getProductReviews(req.params.id).then((product_reviews) =\u003e {\n      return res.json({\n        product_reviews\n      })\n    })\n  })\n\n  return router;\n}\n```\n\nNotice that you have to use the `cors` middleware with the configuration imported from `medusa-config.js` for each route. If you don’t use the `cors` middleware for the routes then you will not be able to access them from the storefront or from the admin.\n\nIn the `GET` route `/store/products/:id/reviews`, you retrieve the `productReviewService` that is registered in the scope by the Medusa server when you run it. You then use the service to retrieve the reviews using the method `getProductReviews`.\n\nThe `GET` route `/admin/products/:id/reviews` is similar to the `GET` route `/store/products/:id/reviews`, but it uses the cors options for admin requests.\n\nIn the `POST` route `/store/products/:id/reviews` , you retrieve the `productReviewService` and use the `addProductReview` method to add a review for the product, then return the created product review.\n\n## Run the Server\n\nTo run the server, run the following command:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis runs the server on `localhost:9000`. Make sure the server is running throughout the tutorial.\n\nYou can test out the endpoints you just added through a tool like Postman, but you’ll be testing them out throughout the rest of the tutorial.\n\n## **Open Source Ecommerce Platform Admin Setup** Admin Setup\n\nThe next step is to install and set up the [Medusa Admin](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/quickstart) for your online store.\n\nIn your terminal and in a different directory than the Medusa server, run the following command to install the Medusa admin for your online store:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/medusajs/admin medusa-reviews-admin\n```\n\nThen, change to the newly-created directory `medusa-reviews-admin` and install the necessary dependencies:\n\n```\ncd medusa-reviews-admin\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Create Reviews Component\n\nYou’ll show the reviews on the details page of each product.\n\nSo, create the file `src/domain/products/product-form/sections/reviews.js` with the following content:\n\n```\nimport { Box, Flex, Text } from \"rebass\"\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from \"react\"\n\nimport BodyCard from \"../../../../components/organisms/body-card\"\nimport { ReactComponent as Star } from \"../../../../assets/svg-2.0/star.svg\"\nimport medusaRequest from \"../../../../services/request\"\n\nconst Reviews = ({ id }) =\u003e {\n  const [reviews, setReviews] = useState([])\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    medusaRequest(\"get\", `/admin/products/${id}/reviews`)\n      .then((response) =\u003e setReviews(response.data.product_reviews))\n      .catch((e) =\u003e console.error(e))\n  }, [])\n\n  return (\n    \u003cBodyCard title=\"Product Reviews\"\u003e\n\t\t\t{reviews.length === 0 \u0026\u0026 (\n        \u003cspan\u003eThere are no reviews for this product\u003c/span\u003e\n      )}\n      {reviews.length \u003e 0 \u0026\u0026\n        reviews.map((review) =\u003e (\n          \u003cBox key={review.id} bg=\"light\" padding=\"2\" mb=\"2\"\u003e\n            \u003cFlex justifyContent=\"space-between\"\u003e\n              \u003cBox mr={4}\u003e\n                \u003cText fontWeight=\"700\" mb={3}\u003e\n                  {review.title}\n                \u003c/Text\u003e\n              \u003c/Box\u003e\n              \u003cFlex mr={4}\u003e\n                {Array(review.rating)\n                  .fill(0)\n                  .map(() =\u003e (\n                    \u003cStar fill=\"yellow\" /\u003e\n                  ))}\n              \u003c/Flex\u003e\n            \u003c/Flex\u003e\n            \u003cText color=\"gray\"\u003eBy {review.user_name}\u003c/Text\u003e\n            \u003cbr /\u003e\n            \u003cText\u003e{review.content}\u003c/Text\u003e\n            \u003cbr /\u003e\n            \u003cText color=\"gray\"\u003e{review.created_at}\u003c/Text\u003e\n          \u003c/Box\u003e\n        ))}\n    \u003c/BodyCard\u003e\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Reviews\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, you retrieve the reviews from the ecommerce server using the endpoint you created earlier, then you display the reviews if there are any.\n\nThen, in `src/domain/products/product-form/index.tsx` import the `Reviews` component at the top of the file:\n\n```\nimport Reviews from \"./sections/reviews\"\n```\n\nAnd in the returned JSX in the component, add the following before the `div` wrapping `RawJSON`:\n\n```\n//add this\n\u003cdiv className=\"mt-large\"\u003e\n  \u003cReviews id={product.id} /\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n//before this\n\u003cdiv className=\"mt-large\"\u003e\n  \u003cRawJSON data={product} title=\"Raw product\" /\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n### Test it Out\n\nIf you run your medusa admin with the following command:\n\n```\nnpm run develop\n```\n\nYou’ll first be asked to log in to the admin. You can use the demo email “admin@medusa-test.com” and password “supersecret”.\n\nAfter you log in, go to the Products page from the sidebar, then choose one of the existing products on your ecommerce site.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-05-30\\_at\\_4.07.38\\_PM.png)\n\nScroll down and you should find “Product Reviews” but there are currently no reviews to view on your ecommerce website.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-05-30\\_at\\_2.53.35\\_PM.png)\n\nYou’ll come back to this page after adding the “Add Review” functionality on the storefront of your ecommerce website.\n\n## Setup Next.js Storefront **for your Online Store**\n\nThis section covers how to show product reviews on the [Next.js storefront](https://docs.medusajs.com/starters/nextjs-medusa-starter) and allow users to add their reviews on your ecommerce website.\n\nIf you’re alternatively using the Gatsby storefront or your custom storefront for your ecommerce website, you can still follow along to see the general approach of how to implement it in the storefront of your ecommerce website.\n\nIn your terminal and in a different directory than the directories holding the Medusa server and Medusa admin, run the following command to install the Next.js storefront:\n\n```\nnpx create-next-app -e https://github.com/medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa medusa-reviews-storefront\n```\n\nThen, change to the newly created directory `medusa-reviews-storefront` and rename the `.env` file:\n\n```\ncd medusa-reviews-storefront\nmv .env.template .env.local\n```\n\nYou need to install a few libraries that are useful for this tutorial:\n\n```\nnpm install --save @heroicons/react react-hyper-modal yup\n```\n\nWhere `@heroicons/react` is used to show a star icon for the rating, `react-hyper-modal` is used to easily create a modal for the product review form, and `yup` is used for the form validation.\n\n### Implement Product Reviews\n\nIn this section, you’ll show the product reviews under the description on every product page. You’ll also show a button to add a new review. This button opens a modal with a form to add the review.\n\nIn `pages/product/[id].js` add the following imports at the beginning of the file:\n\n```\nimport * as Yup from 'yup';\nimport { useFormik } from \"formik\";\nimport HyperModal from 'react-hyper-modal';\nimport { StarIcon } from \"@heroicons/react/solid\";\nimport axios from \"axios\";\n```\n\nThen, at the beginning of the `Product` component, add the following state variables:\n\n```\nconst [reviews, setReviews] = useState([]);\nconst [isModalOpen, setModalOpen] = useState(false);\n```\n\nThe `reviews` state variable is used to store the reviews retrieved from the server. The `isModalOpen` state variable is used to control whether the modal holding the product review form is opened or closed.\n\nAlso, add a variable that uses [Formik](https://formik.org) and [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) to easily create a form with validation functionalities:\n\n```\nconst reviewFormik = useFormik({\n  initialValues: {\n    title: \"\",\n    user_name: \"\",\n    rating: 1,\n    content: \"\"\n  },\n  validationSchema: Yup.object().shape({\n    title: Yup.string().required(),\n    user_name: Yup.string().required(),\n    rating: Yup.number().min(1).max(5),\n    content: Yup.string().required()\n  }),\n  onSubmit: (values) =\u003e {\n    axios.post(`${BACKEND_URL}/store/products/${product.id}/reviews`, {\n      data: {\n        title: values.title,\n        user_name: values.user_name,\n        rating: values.rating,\n        content: values.content\n      }\n    })\n    .then(() =\u003e {\n      getReviews()\n      setModalOpen(false)\n    })\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThis form has 4 fields: `title`, `user_name`, `rating`, and `content`. All fields are required, and the value of the `rating` field must be at least 1 and at most 5\n\nOn submit, a `POST` request is sent to the endpoint you created earlier, and you pass the review data in the body. Then, the reviews are retrieved from the server using the `getReviews` function and the modal is closed.\n\nNext, add the `getReviews` function and a `useEffect` that gets the reviews whenever the `product` changes:\n\n```\nuseEffect(() =\u003e {\n  if (product) {\n    getReviews()\n  }\n// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\n}, [product])\n\nfunction getReviews () {\n  axios.get(`${BACKEND_URL}/store/products/${product.id}/reviews`)\n    .then((response) =\u003e setReviews(response.data.product_reviews))\n}\n```\n\nThis retrieves the reviews from the server using the endpoint you created earlier on the server.\n\nFinally, add the following before the last 3 closing `div` elements in the returned JSX:\n\n```\n//add this\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv style={{marginTop: \"30px\"}}\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003eProduct Reviews\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cHyperModal\n          isOpen={isModalOpen}\n          requestClose={() =\u003e setModalOpen(false)}\n          renderOpenButton={() =\u003e {\n            return (\n              \u003cbutton className={styles.addbtn} onClick={() =\u003e setModalOpen(true)}\u003eAdd Review\u003c/button\u003e\n            );\n          }}\n        \u003e\n          \u003cform onSubmit={reviewFormik.handleSubmit} style={{padding: \"20px\"}}\u003e\n            \u003ch2\u003eAdd Review\u003c/h2\u003e\n            \u003cdiv style={{marginBottom: \"10px\"}}\u003e\n              \u003clabel htmlFor=\"title\"\u003eTitle\u003c/label\u003e\n              \u003cinput type=\"text\" name=\"title\" id=\"title\" onChange={reviewFormik.handleChange}\n                value={reviewFormik.values.title} style={{display: \"block\", width: \"100%\"}} /\u003e\n              {reviewFormik.touched.title \u0026\u0026 reviewFormik.errors.title \u0026\u0026 \u003cspan style={{color: \"red\"}}\u003e{reviewFormik.errors.title}\u003c/span\u003e}\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003cdiv style={{marginBottom: \"10px\"}}\u003e\n              \u003clabel htmlFor=\"user_name\"\u003eUser Name\u003c/label\u003e\n              \u003cinput type=\"text\" name=\"user_name\" id=\"user_name\" onChange={reviewFormik.handleChange}\n                value={reviewFormik.values.user_name} style={{display: \"block\", width: \"100%\"}} /\u003e\n              {reviewFormik.touched.user_name \u0026\u0026 reviewFormik.errors.user_name \u0026\u0026 \u003cspan style={{color: \"red\"}}\u003e{reviewFormik.errors.user_name}\u003c/span\u003e}\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003cdiv style={{marginBottom: \"10px\"}}\u003e\n              \u003clabel htmlFor=\"rating\"\u003eRating\u003c/label\u003e\n              \u003cinput type=\"number\" name=\"rating\" id=\"rating\" onChange={reviewFormik.handleChange}\n                value={reviewFormik.values.rating} min=\"1\" max=\"5\" style={{display: \"block\", width: \"100%\"}} /\u003e\n              {reviewFormik.touched.rating \u0026\u0026 reviewFormik.errors.rating \u0026\u0026 \u003cspan style={{color: \"red\"}}\u003e{reviewFormik.errors.rating}\u003c/span\u003e}\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003cdiv style={{marginBottom: \"10px\"}}\u003e\n              \u003clabel htmlFor=\"content\"\u003eContent\u003c/label\u003e\n              \u003ctextarea name=\"content\" id=\"content\" onChange={reviewFormik.handleChange} \n                value={reviewFormik.values.content} style={{display: \"block\", width: \"100%\"}} rows={5}\u003e\u003c/textarea\u003e\n              {reviewFormik.touched.content \u0026\u0026 reviewFormik.errors.content \u0026\u0026 \u003cspan style={{color: \"red\"}}\u003e{reviewFormik.errors.content}\u003c/span\u003e}\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003cbutton className={styles.addbtn}\u003eAdd\u003c/button\u003e\n          \u003c/form\u003e\n        \u003c/HyperModal\u003e\n        {reviews.length === 0 \u0026\u0026 \u003cdiv style={{marginTop: \"10px\"}}\u003eThere are no product reviews\u003c/div\u003e}\n        {reviews.length \u003e 0 \u0026\u0026 reviews.map((review, index) =\u003e (\n          \u003cdiv key={review.id} style={{marginTop: \"10px\", marginBottom: \"10px\"}}\u003e\n            \u003cdiv style={{display: \"flex\", justifyContent: \"space-between\", alignItems: \"center\"}}\u003e\n              \u003ch3\u003e{review.title}\u003c/h3\u003e\n              \u003cdiv style={{display: \"flex\"}}\u003e\n                {Array(review.rating).fill(0).map((_, index) =\u003e \u003cStarIcon key={index} style={{color: \"#FFDF00\", height: \"24px\", width: \"24px\"}} /\u003e)}\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003csmall style={{color: \"grey\"}}\u003eBy {review.user_name}\u003c/small\u003e\n            \u003cdiv style={{marginTop: \"10px\", marginBottom: \"10px\"}}\u003e{review.content}\u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003csmall style={{color: \"grey\"}}\u003e{review.created_at}\u003c/small\u003e\n            {index !== reviews.length -

This modal is opened by the “Add Review” button. When it’s opened, a form with 3 input fields and a textarea is shown to add the review. When the form is submitted, the function passed to `onSubmit` in the options object of `useFormik` is executed.\n\nThen, if there are any reviews, you render them one by one.\n\n## Test it Out\n\nTo run the server for the storefront of your ecommerce website, run the following command:\n\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nThis runs the storefront on `localhost:8000`. Open it in your browser and choose one of the products. You can see that it has no reviews.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-05-30\\_at\\_3.12.38\\_PM.png)\n\nClick on Add Review to add a review. A modal opens with the form to add a product review.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-05-30\\_at\\_1.40.41\\_PM.png)\n\nFill out the form and click Add. You should be able to see the reviews you add now. Add as many as you want.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-05-30\\_at\\_12.54.52\\_PM.png)\n\nGo back to the admin panel and open the page of the product you just added reviews to. You should see the same reviews now on the admin panel.\n\n![](/images/Screen_Shot\\_2022-05-30\\_at\\_12.23.54\\_PM.png)\n\n## What’s Next\n\nThere’s still much more that you can do in your Medusa server to customize it with all the services and ecommerce features that you need:\n\n*   Use [Stripe](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/stripe) as a Payment Provider\n*   Integrate your server with [Slack](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/slack) for automated notifications whenever a new order is placed.\n*   Deploy [your server on Heroku](https://docs.medusajs.com/how-to/deploying-on-heroku) and [your Medusa admin on Netlify](https://docs.medusajs.com/how-to/deploying-admin-on-netlify).\n\nShould you have any issues or questions related to Medusa, then feel free to reach out to the Medusa team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp).\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/how-to-create-custom-endpoints-in-medusa.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/how-to-create-custom-endpoints-in-medusa.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/how-to-create-custom-endpoints-in-medusa.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"How to Create Custom Endpoints in Medusa","date":"2022-05-26","excerpt":"In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to create custom endpoints on your Medusa server for both the storefront and admin.","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/article-standard-thumbnail-example-687a5326.png","altText":"How to Create Custom Endpoints in Medusa","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-eb2no2kx3.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-eb2no2kx3.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-eb2no2kx3.json"},"firstName":"Shahed ","lastName":"Nasser","role":"Role","image":{"url":"/images/27354907.jpeg","altText":"Person photo"},"type":"Person"}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-a9wemp4po.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-a9wemp4po.json"},"name":"Other","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"\n\u003ccallout icon=\"exclamationCircleSolid\" button-label=\"Go to Docs\" button-url=\"http://docs.medusajs.com\"\u003e\n**Notice**\nMedusa is under active development, so the content of this post may be outdated. Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\n[Medusa](https://medusajs.com/) is an open source headless commerce platform built using Node.js. It aims to provide developers with a great experience and limitless customization capabilities.\n\nThe core of Medusa is the headless server. It exposes a [set of APIs](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store/auth/) that the other 2 components, admin and storefront, can use to connect to the server and access or manipulate data.\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to create custom endpoints on your Medusa server for both the storefront and admin.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nThis tutorial assumes you already have a Medusa server installed. If not, you can follow the [Quickstart guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start) to get started in a few minutes.\n\n## Overview\n\nCustom endpoints reside under the `src/api` directory in your Medusa Backend. To define a new endpoint, you can add the file `index.js` under the `src/api` directory. This file should export a function that returns an Express router.\n\nYour endpoint can be under any path you wish.\n\n### **Storefront Endpoint**\n\nBy Medusa’s conventions, all Storefront REST APIs are prefixed by `/store`. For example, the `/store/products` lets you retrieve the products to display them on your storefront.\n\n### Admin Endpoint\n\nBy Medusa’s conventions, all Admin REST APIs are prefixed by `/admin`. For example, the `/admin/products` lets you retrieve the products to display them on your Admin.\n\n## Implementation\n\nTo create a new endpoint, start by creating a new file in `src/api` called `index.js`. At its basic format, `index.js` should look something like this:\n\n```\nimport { Router } from \"express\"\n\nexport default () =\u003e {\n  const router = Router()\n\n  router.get(\"/hello\", (req, res) =\u003e {\n    res.json({\n      message: \"Welcome to Your Store!\",\n    })\n  })\n\n  return router\n}\n```\n\nThis endpoint is accessible under the path `/hello`. If you want to create an endpoint for the storefront and follow Medusa’s conventions you can prefix the path with `/store`:\n\n```\nrouter.get(\"/store/hello\", (req, res) =\u003e {\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can create an endpoint for the admin and follow Medusa’s conventions by prefixing the path with `/admin`:\n\n```\nrouter.get(\"/admin/hello\", (req, res) =\u003e {\n```\n\n## Making Endpoints Accessible from the Admin\n\nIf you’re customizing the admin dashboard or creating your own, you need to use the `cors` library. An `OPTIONS` request should be added for each route and handle the requests with the `cors` library.\n\nFirst, you need to import your Medusa’s configurations along with the `cors` library:\n\n```\nimport cors from \"cors\"\nimport { projectConfig } from \"../../medusa-config\"\n```\n\nThen, create an object that holds the CORS configurations:\n\n```\nconst corsOptions = {\n  origin: projectConfig.admin_cors.split(\",\"),\n  credentials: true,\n}\n```\n\nFinally, for each route you add, create an `OPTIONS` request:\n\n```\nrouter.options(\"/admin/hello\", cors(corsOptions))\nrouter.get(\"/admin/hello\", (req, res) =\u003e {\n  //...\n})\n```\n\n## Multiple Endpoints\n\n### **Same File**\n\nYou can add more than one endpoints in `src/api/index.js`:\n\n```\nrouter.get(\"/admin/hello\", (req, res) =\u003e {\n  res.json({\n    message: \"Welcome to Your Store!\",\n  })\n})\n\nrouter.get(\"/admin/bye\", (req, res) =\u003e {\n  res.json({\n    message: \"Come back again!\",\n  })\n})\n```\n\n### Multiple Files\n\nAlternatively, you can add multiple files for each endpoint or set of endpoints for readability and easy maintenance.\n\nTo do that with the previous example, first, create the file `src/api/hello.js` with the following content:\n\n```\nexport default (router) =\u003e {\n  router.get(\"/admin/hello\", (req, res) =\u003e {\n    res.json({\n      message: \"Welcome to Your Store!\",\n    })\n  })\n}\n```\n\nYou export a function that receives an Express router as a parameter and adds the endpoint `admin/hello` to it.\n\nNext, create the file `src/api/bye.js` with the following content:\n\n```\nexport default (router) =\u003e {\n  router.get(\"/admin/bye\", (req, res) =\u003e {\n    res.json({\n      message: \"Come back again!\",\n    })\n  })\n}\n```\n\nAgain, you export a function that receives an Express router as a parameter and adds the endpoint `admin/bye` to it.\n\nFinally, in `src/api/index.js` import the two functions at the beginning of the file:\n\n```\nimport helloRoute from \"./hello\"\nimport byeRoute from \"./bye\"\n```\n\nand in the exported function, call each of the functions passing them the Express router:\n\n```\nexport default () =\u003e {\n  const router = Router()\n\n  helloRoute(router)\n  byeRoute(router)\n\n  return router\n}\n```\n\n## Use Services\n\n[Services](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/services/create-service) in Medusa bundle a set of functionalities related to a model into one class. Then, you can use that class anywhere in your backend. For example, you can use the `ProductService` to retrieve products or perform operations like creating or updating a product.\n\nYou can retrieve any registered service in your endpoint using `req.scope.resolve` passing it the service’s registration name.\n\nHere’s an example of an endpoint that retrieves the count of products in your store:\n\n```\nrouter.get(\"/admin/products/count\", (req, res) =\u003e {\n  const productService = req.scope.resolve(\"productService\")\n\n  productService.count().then((count) =\u003e {\n    res.json({\n      count,\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n\nThe `productService` has a `count` method that returns a Promise. This Promise resolves to the count of the products. You return a JSON of the product count.\n\n## Protected Routes for\n\nProtected routes are routes that should be accessible by logged-in users only.\n\nTo make a route protected, first, import the `authenticate` middleware:\n\n```\nimport authenticate from \"@medusajs/medusa/dist/api/middlewares/authenticate\"\n```\n\nThen, add the middleware to your route:\n\n```\nrouter.get(\"/store/products/count\", authenticate(), (req, res) =\u003e {\n  //...\n})\n```\n\nNow, only authenticated customers or users can access this endpoint.\n\n### Accessing Current Customer\n\nYou can get the logged-in customer’s ID using `req.user`:\n\n```\nconst id = req.user.customer_id\n```\n\nTo get the customer’s details, you can use the `customerService`:\n\n```\nconst id = req.user.customer_id\nconst customerService = req.scope.resolve(\"customerService\")\n\nconst customer = await customerService.retrieve(id)\n```\n\n### Accessing Current User\n\nYou can get the logged-in user ID using `req.user`:\n\n```\nconst id = req.user.userId\n```\n\nTo get the user’s details, you can use the `userService`:\n\n```\nconst id = req.user.userId\nconst userService = req.scope.resolve(\"userService\")\n\nconst user = await userService.retrieve(id)\n```\n\n## Route Parameters\n\nThe routes you create receive 2 parameters. The first one is the absolute path to the root directory that your server is running from. The second one is an object that has your plugin's options. If your API route is not implemented in a plugin, then it will be an empty object.\n\n```\nexport default (rootDirectory, pluginOptions) =\u003e {\n  const router = Router()\n\n  //...\n}\n```\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nEndpoints are just one essential part of Medusa’s architecture.

Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\n[Medusa](https://medusajs.com/) is an open source ecommerce platform with plenty of features that boost the ecommerce experience for merchants while providing a great developer experience.\n\nAs a headless commerce platform, Medusa’s server architecture is composed of a few components that have different purposes and usages.\n\nThis article in particular focuses on Subscribers, what’s their purpose, and how they can be used to handle events in Medusa.\n\n## Overview\n\nIn Medusa, there are events that are emitted when a certain action occurs. For example, if a customer places an order, the `order.placed` event is emitted with the order data.\n\nThese events are designed to allow other parts of the platform or third-party integrations to listen to them and take action accordingly.\n\nSubscribers register handlers for an events and allows you to perform an action when that event occurs. For example, if you want to send your customer an email when they place an order, then you can listen to the `order.placed` event and send the email when the event is emitted.\n\nNatively in Medusa there are subscribers to handle different events. However, you can also create your own custom subscribers.\n\nCustom subscribers reside in your project's `src/subscribers` directory. Files here should export classes, which will be treated as subscribers by Medusa. By convention, the class name should end with `Subscriber` and the file name should be the camel-case version of the class name without `Subscriber`. For example, the `WelcomeSubscriber` class is in the file `src/subscribers/welcome.js`.\n\nWhenever an event is emitted, the subscriber’s registered handler method is executed. The handler method receives as a parameter an object that holds data related to the event. For example, if an order is placed the `order.placed` event will be emitted and all the handlers will receive the order id in the parameter object.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nMedusa's event system works by pushing data to a Queue that each handler then gets notified of. The queuing system is based on Redis and you will therefore need to make sure that [Redis](https://redis.io/) is installed and configured for your Medusa project.\n\nThen, you need to set your Redis URL in your Medusa server. By default, the Redis URL is `redis://localhost:6379`. If you use a different one, set the following environment variable in `.env`:\n\n```\nREDIS_URL=\u003cYOUR_REDIS_URL\u003e\n```\n\nAfter that, in `medusa-config.js`, you’ll need to comment out the following line:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  projectConfig: {\n    redis_url: REDIS_URL, //this line is commented out\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAfter that, you are able to listen to events on your server.\n\n## How to Create a Custom Subscriber\n\nAfter creating the file under `src/subscribers`, in the constructor of your subscriber, you should listen to events using `eventBusService.subscribe` , where `eventBusService` is a service injected into your subscriber’s constructor.\n\nThe `eventBusService.subscribe` method takes an event name as its first parameter, and a callback function as its second parameter. This callback will be executed when the event is fired.\n\nFor example, here is the `OrderNotifierSubscriber` class which is created in `src/subscribers/orderNotifier.js`:\n\n```\nclass OrderNotifierSubscriber {\n  constructor({ eventBusService }) {\n    eventBusService.subscribe(\"order.placed\", this.handleOrder);\n  }\n\n  handleOrder = async (data) =\u003e {\n    console.log(\"New Order: \" + data.id)\n  };\n}\n\nexport default OrderNotifierSubscriber;\n```\n\nThis subscriber will register the method `handleOrder` as one of the handlers of the `order.placed` event. The method `handleOrder` will be executed every time an order is placed, and it will receive the order ID in the `data` parameter. You can then use the order’s details to perform any kind of task you need.\n\nThe `data` object will not contain other order data. Only the ID of the order. You can retrieve the order information using the `orderService`.\n\n## Using Services in Subscribers\n\nYou can access any [service](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/services/create-service) through the dependencies injected to your subscriber’s constructor.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nconstructor({ productService, eventBusService }) {\n    this.productService = productService;\n\n    eventBusService.subscribe(\"order.placed\", this.handleOrder);\n}\n```\n\nYou can then use `this.productService` anywhere in your subscriber’s methods.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSubscribers are just one part of Medusa’s architecture.

It also became [the most valuable automotive brand](https://www.statista.com/statistics/267830/brand-values-of-the-top-10-most-valuable-car-brands/). So many things set Tesla apart from other car brands that helped it achieve this glory. And one of the - probably less known - aspects is its online sales model.\n\nTesla maximized and optimized its online ecommerce experience and internal operations by creating an ERP software of its own. This ERP software includes the ecommerce software that powers Tesla’s online sales model. \n\nThis put Tesla ahead of its competitors, as in many countries around the world including Spain and Italy it’s the only car brand that [operates online in those countries](https://www.bearingpoint.com/en/about-us/news-and-media/press-releases/bearingpoint-study-tesla-still-dominates-online-sales-of-new-vehicles/).\n\nBut why did Tesla decide to create this custom system? And how does it prove the case of the need for open source tools in 2022?\n\n## A Brief Look at Tesla’s Success\n\nTesla had major success in 2021. Their production rate jumped from [367K vehicles in 2019 to almost 1M vehicles per year](https://www.statista.com/chart/8547/teslas-vehicle-deliveries-since-2012/) at the end of September 2021.\n\nThis is reflected in Tesla’s revenue. In 2021, [Tesla’s revenue for automotive sales surpassed 44 U.S. billion dollars](https://www.statista.com/statistics/314741/revenue-of-tesla-by-segment/). It’s a huge rise compared to its revenue in 2019 which was 19 U.S. billion dollars.\n\nTesla’s total revenue combining all its streams reached 54 billion dollars in 2021. This made it [the best-selling electric vehicles brand worldwide](https://www.statista.com/statistics/960121/sales-of-all-electric-vehicles-worldwide-by-model/).\n\nIt should be noted with this major difference between 2019 and 2021 that Tesla announced [in 2019 that they would be closing all of their stores](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/tesla-shifts-sales-to-online-only.html) and selling online only.\n\nThis success in their online sales model majorly had to do with the ERP software that they [created early on in 2013](https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/31/being-a-cio-at-tesla-motors-a-startup-that-builds-cars-and-its-own-it/). It allowed them to provide better customer service and have all departments in Tesla connected using the same system.\n\n## Why did Elon Musk Choose to Build Tesla’s Own Software?\n\n### Existing Proprietary Software Weren’t Enough\n\nIn 2013, Tesla did try using proprietary enterprise software for their ERP and ecommerce software. However, they quickly realized it wouldn’t work for their use case.\n\n\u003e “Something that people don't really know much about is our internal applications team that writes the core technology that runs the company. We are not dependent on [third party] enterprise software. Like for those who understand what this means, this is a very big deal. And my hat is off to the great work of the internal applications team. They are like the nervous system, the operating system of the company, the Tesla operating system. They are extremely fundamental.” — [Elon Musk](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/22/tesla-tsla-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)\n\u003e \n\nIf you’re not familiar with Tesla’s online sales model, they allow customers to customize their cars such as choosing different materials or colors. It also, after its shift to online sales in 2019, started providing same-hour customer support and even same-day service. It also gave customers a week to refund their cars if needed.\n\nIn short, Tesla’s mission was to have customizable cars, reliable customer service, and an almost automated delivery and refund process, among other operations in the company.\n\nMost existing platforms wouldn’t have all these features built-in. It would require you to use custom plugins and integrations to add those features, but it would still be restrictive for companies that have a custom business model like Tesla.\n\n### Tesla Needed a Solution Specific to Them\n\nTesla needed a solution that they can dig into and make changes to make it completely fit their use case. \n\nIn fact, most businesses need a solution like that even if they’re not as big as Tesla or have similar business requirements. Almost all businesses have unique operations based on their products and communication with customers, among other operations.\n\nElon Musk realized that early on and decided to invest in a team that would build this solution for Tesla from scratch.\n\nSo, Tesla hired a new CIO [Jay Vijayan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayvijayan) who, along with a technical team of more than 250 people, in 4 months built the ERP system, called Warp, which currently is an essential part of Tesla’s operations and online sales platform. Warp is now the foundation of Tesla.\n\nWarp was a unique solution for Tesla that allowed them to manage different aspects of their operations and departments, ecommerce sales, customer relations, and more all from one system.\n\n### Managing Information Flow\n\nAnother aspect that a lot of businesses struggle with is managing communication between different departments under its wings and how the information flows between and to them.\n\nThis proves to be difficult as, again, most existing solutions to manage this connection wouldn’t fit the business’s requirements. Businesses invest a lot in trying to make this work and put as much control on how the information is flowing among their systems, but often fail or don’t have a flexible and optimized solution for their use case.\n\nIn Tesla’s case, their ERP system enabled all departments to be connected just using that system. They didn’t need any custom or external connectors to make this happen. They were also able to route the necessary information to the correct people that need to see or handle them.\n\n\u003e “...the way we built it is we were able to show the feedback coming from customers to the right people in the right department instantly. That never existed in the automotive world before Tesla” — Jay Vijayan, [interview with Techfest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iejPy8wiv40)\n\u003e \n\nThey realized they had a specific use case, and they made sure to incorporate that in their development of the ERP system.\n\nThis, again, emphasizes how this ERP system is Tesla’s foundation. It was built in a way to cater to the ecommerce part but also eliminate the need for external tools to manage other operations in different departments. All departments can work together through this same software.\n\n## How Tesla’s Ecommerce Choice Shows the Need for Open Source Solutions\n\nTesla decided to create their ERP and ecommerce software from scratch internally. However, at that time open source solutions were much less mature than they are now that it wasn’t an existing option. Businesses now can instead utilize open source solutions to create the system they need.\n\n### Open Source Allows You to Customize Everything\n\nOpen source solutions can be used in any type of project. You can use it as-is if it fits your use case, but what’s special about it is that you can modify it and change it into whatever you want.\n\nThis allows businesses to avoid starting from scratch when building their systems and go for an open source solution that already has the groundwork finished. They can then take it apart and make the changes as they see fit for them.\n\nThis would remove them from the shackles of enterprise software that prevent them from truly owning their tech stack and allow them to have ultimate control over their solution.\n\n### Open Source Alternatives are More Compelling Than Ever\n\nAs opposed to enterprise solutions not being enough, you can always find an open source solution to either make an integral part of your system or integrate it into your existing system.\n\nCompared to the time Tesla needed to create their ERP and ecommerce software, there are much more reliable and mature open source solutions that have been changing the market and are used by many. Some examples of these open source solutions include [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com) and [Strapi](https://strapi.io).\n\nThese open source choices are coming to offer a more customizable alternative to a lot of existing enterprise and commercial solutions that can be fitted to individual business needs.\n\nBeing able to use multiple open source solutions and integrate them together eliminates the need to reinvent the wheel and instead gives you a good starting point to build your own custom setup.\n\n### More Control Over Different Components\n\nIn most cases with enterprise solutions, businesses will need to integrate other enterprise or commercial solutions into the mix to try and provide them with the perfect solution they need. However, they still won’t have full control of the implementation which leads to more obstacles and restrictions.\n\nOn the other hand, as you have full ownership of your open source tech stack, you are free to control your system, its different components, and how they work together. \n\nThis is basically what Tesla did with their ERP software: they took control of the different components that would be used by different departments in Tesla and put them together in a way that no mediator is needed for the communication.\n\nGoing specifically into headless commerce platforms like [Medusa](https://medusajs.com), the abstraction in its architecture allows for better integration among different components in your system. This abstract and headless approach opposed to the traditional monolithic architecture makes it even easier for your business to customize the open source solution even further.\n\n## How Proprietary Ecommerce Tools Got the Thesis Right But the Product Wrong\n\nProprietary ecommerce software has been pushing towards providing businesses with customization capabilities through either headless solutions like combining Shopify and Commercetools or through a micro-services approach like Fabric. Depending on the software, this would include customizations more related to the frontend.\n\nHowever, as you can see from Tesla’s use case customizations to the frontend aren’t enough. Most businesses would need to customize the backend to provide custom and more complex features, which proves challenging to do with proprietary software as they generally don’t provide customization capabilities to the backend.\n\nThese platforms are also often advertised as platforms that businesses can use without any technical knowledge. This sounds appealing to a lot of businesses, especially the ones starting fresh and are excited to start selling.\n\nHowever, what proprietary tools don’t realize is that as long as the businesses don’t have full control over their technical stack, as long as they need external third-party apps or solutions to make their vision come to life, and as long as the businesses have to implement hacky solutions to introduce custom features specific to their use case, they’ve got the product wrong.\n\nProprietary tools put a lot of restrictions on businesses because they try to create a one-size-fits-all solution. Ecommerce platforms and software are generally envisioned as just a platform you use to buy and sell online. However, there’s much more to that. There are logistics and operations that are most of the time very specific to each business. In short: there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to ecommerce.\n\nUsing open source solutions, on the other hand, is an option that is best for businesses, especially in the long run. Businesses would be investing in a platform that is capable of growing with them and can be customized and extended as needed. They would be investing in a platform with no shortcomings or restrictions.\n\n## Get Started with Open Source Commerce\n\nOpen source solutions prove time and time again that they’re the future of ecommerce, if not technology in general. They give businesses and individuals alike more freedom and flexibility to implement their visions and dreams.\n\nMore businesses are coming to realize that the only way they can set themselves apart and bring their vision to life is either through a system they build entirely themselves as Tesla did or through open source solutions that can facilitate the process.\n\n[Medusa](https://medusajs.com/) is one open source ecommerce solution that aims to provide developers and businesses alike with a great experience creating their ecommerce platform. Out of the box, Medusa provides many [essential features](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#features) for businesses including RMA flows, multi-currency and multi-region support, highly customizable promotions and discounts, and an [intuitive admin](https://demo.medusajs.com/a/orders?offset=0\u0026limit=15) that allows you to use these features and much more.\n\nMost importantly, Medusa’s headless architecture makes it easily extendable and customizable.

This article showcases an integration for SendGrid with Medusa.","markdown_content":"\n\u003ccallout icon=\"exclamationCircleSolid\" button-label=\"Go to Docs\" button-url=\"http://docs.medusajs.com\"\u003e\n**Notice**\nMedusa is under active development, so the content of this post may be outdated. Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\nMedusa is an open source headless commerce platform that aims to provide a good developer experience. One thing it does well is it integrates with other popular services hassle-free to provide developers and merchants alike with more features in their ecommerce store.\n\n[SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/why-sendgrid/) is an email delivery and marketing service that allows you to create personalized emails for your customers. SendGrid makes it easy for you to customize your email templates without any technical knowledge.\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn about how you can integrate SendGrid in Medusa as the primary email notification system using the [ready-made plugin](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/tree/master/packages/medusa-plugin-sendgrid).\n\n## Integration Features\n\nBy integrating SendGrid and Medusa you’ll be able to send emails to your customers and users in the following cases:\n\n1.  Order-related events include new orders, shipments created, and orders canceled.\n2.  Swaps and Returns related events including new return requests of orders and items returned successfully.\n3.  When Gift Cards are created in an order.\n4.  User-related events including reset passwords for both customers and admin users.\n5.  Restock Notifications for when product stocks are low.\n\nThis plugin also allows you to cater to multiple languages using localized templates if you define them in your SendGrid account.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n### Medusa Server\n\nIf you don’t have a Medusa server set up, make sure to follow the [Quickstart guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start) to get started in minutes.\n\n### Redis\n\nIn Medusa, events are triggered asynchronously and Subscribers handle these events if they are subscribed to them. This is done through [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/) which is used as an event queue. So, you need to have Redis installed and configured on your Medusa server before you proceed.\n\nYou can follow the [development environment setup guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/tutorial/set-up-your-development-environment) for steps on this.\n\n### SendGrid Account\n\nLastly, you need a SendGrid account that you’ll connect with Medusa. If you don’t have one, make sure to [create one](https://signup.sendgrid.com/) first. You also need to set up a [single sender](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/sender-verification) in your account. If you don’t you won’t be able to send emails through your SendGrid account.\n\n## Obtain SendGrid API Key\n\nThe SendGrid plugin requires an API key to give Medusa access to send emails through SendGrid.\n\nTo obtain an API Key from SendGrid, choose from the sidebar on your SendGrid dashboard Settings \u003e API Keys.\n\nThen, click on the Create API Key button.\n\n![Create API Key](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c1nwaclha7ggorjkmqpe.png)\n\nAPI keys in SendGrid have 3 types of access: Full Access, Restricted Access, and Billing Access. To make sure this API key allows Medusa to send emails on your behalf, you should either choose Full Access or Restricted Access giving it at least the “Mail Send” access.\n\n![Mail Send Access](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/v9w46x2azg648pmfpm24.png)\n\nOnce you’re done click Create \u0026 View. This will create the API key and you’ll be allowed to view it only once. So, make sure to copy it for later use.\n\n## Create Email Templates\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the SendGrid plugin will send emails to customers in many cases. For example, when a customer places an order. These emails are only sent if you provide the necessary template ID for each event.\n\nWhen these emails are sent from Medusa to SendGrid, Medusa also passes variables that you can use to display certain information in the email. For example, for the “order placed” email you can display the order total, the items ordered, and more information.\n\nSo, you should create a Dynamic Template for every type of email you want this plugin to send. Dynamic templates allow you to display the variables sent from Medusa [using Handlebars](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/using-handlebars).\n\nIf you’re interested in checking out all types of emails you can send in this plugin and what data your dynamic template will receive, be sure to check out the [Template Reference in the Medusa documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/sendgrid#template-reference).\n\n### Order Placed Template\n\nIn this tutorial, you’ll just be creating a template for the order placed emails.\n\nTo create the email template, from the sidebar go to Email API \u003e Dynamic Templates. Then, click “Create a Dynamic Template”.\n\n![Create Dynamic Template](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vg3u8q0qkjxv14s7dxam.png)\n\nYou’ll then be asked to give your template a name. Once you’re done, click Create. The new template will be added to the list of templates on the page. If you click the template name, you’ll see the template ID. You’ll need this one later on.\n\n![Get Template ID](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ap8ifu1ariee9zkbcjln.png)\n\nTo edit the content of the email, click on Add Version. You can then choose a Blank Template or a SendGrid template. For this tutorial, you’ll choose the Blank Template.\n\nAfter that, you’ll be asked to select a Design Editor or Code Editor. Choose the Design Editor.\n\n![Choose Design Editor](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jqwb8lqdndoehm8cv73g.png)\n\nThis will take you to the drag \u0026 drop email editor. For the simplicity of the tutorial, you’ll be adding two things to the email:\n\n1.  The customer’s name\n2.  The order total\n\nTo do that, click on the Build tab then drag the Code module to the email content. This will open a code editor.\n\nAdd the following in the code editor:\n\n```\n\u003cp\u003eHello, \n{{#if customer.first_name}}\n\t{{ customer.first_name }}\n{{ else }}\n\t{{ shipping_address.first_name }}\n{{/if}}\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour order total: {{ total }}\u003c/p\u003e\n```\n\nYou use the `customer`, `shipping_address`, and `total` variables that will be sent from Medusa. Notice that the customer’s first name will not be set if the customer checks out as a guest. So, you display the name on their shipping address instead.\n\nYou can check out more variables that will be sent for the Order Placed Template in the [Template Reference](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/sendgrid/#order-placed).\n\nThen click Update. After that, click on the Save button at the top.\n\nYou have everything you need now to make the integration happen.\n\n## Install the SendGrid Plugin\n\nIn the root directory of your Medusa server, run the following command to install the SendGrid plugin:\n\n```\nnpm i medusa-plugin-sendgrid\n```\n\n## Add Plugin Configuration\n\nNext, you’ll need to add the API Key, the send from email, and the Template ID in your `.env` file. Notice that you’ll need to add the Template ID of all templates you create:\n\n```\nSENDGRID_API_KEY=\u003cAPI_KEY\u003e\nSENDGRID_FROM=\u003cYOUR_SEND_FROM\u003e\nSENDGRID_ORDER_PLACED_ID=\u003cORDER_PLACED_TEMPLATE_ID\u003e\n```\n\nWhere `\u003cAPI_KEY\u003e` is your API Key, `\u003cYOUR_SEND_FROM\u003e` is the single sender email address you set up in SendGrid, and `\u003cORDER_PLACED_TEMPLATE_ID\u003e` is the ID of the template you created earlier.\n\nThen, in the `medusa-config.js` file in the root of your Medusa server, add the SendGrid plugin into the `plugins` array:\n\n```\nconst plugins = [\n  ...,\n  {\n    resolve: `medusa-plugin-sendgrid`,\n    options: {\n      api_key: process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY,\n      from: process.env.SENDGRID_FROM,\n      order_placed_template: process.env.SENDGRID_ORDER_PLACED_ID,\n    }\n  }\n];\n```\n\nAnd that’s all you need to integrate SendGrid with Medusa.\n\n## Test the Integration\n\nTo test the integration, you need to create an order. The simplest way to do that is to install either Medusa’s [Next.js](https://docs.medusajs.com/starters/nextjs-medusa-starter) or [Gatsby](https://docs.medusajs.com/starters/gatsby-medusa-starter) starter storefronts.\n\nAfter installing one of them, start the Medusa server from its directory:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nThen, start your Medusa storefront and create an order.\n\n![Create an Order](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ut5nyzfq4exc31741j44.png)\n\nIf you check the email you made the order with, you’ll receive an email and you’ll see that the first name and order total are replaced based on your order data.\n\n![Email Sent](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/md3zdkwipq2ve6m7pyeh.png)\n\n## What’s Next\n\nThere are still more use cases you can cater for using this plugin. Make sure to check out the [Template Reference](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/sendgrid/#template-reference) to know what kind of emails you can send and what data they hold.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, you can also send localized emails with this plugin. Check out the [SendGrid plugin documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/sendgrid/#install-the-sendgrid-plugin) for more details on how you can do that.\n\nShould you have any issues or questions related to Medusa, then feel free to reach out to the Medusa team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp).\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/remix-ecommerce.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/remix-ecommerce.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/remix-ecommerce.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Create a Remix Ecommerce store with Medusa","date":"2022-04-07","excerpt":"Tutorial on how to create a Remix ecommerce store together with Medusa.","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/Remix.webp","altText":"Remix ecommerce","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"seo_description":"Tutorial on how to create a Remix ecommerce store together with Medusa.","seo_keywords":"Remix ecommerce","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-ed3n2pi9b.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-ed3n2pi9b.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-ed3n2pi9b.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Wanyoike","image":{"url":"/images/Michael.webp","altText":"Person photo"}}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-29bs7fo47.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json"},"type":"Category","name":"Community"},"markdown_content":"\n\u003ccallout icon=\"exclamationCircleSolid\" button-label=\"Go to Docs\" button-url=\"http://docs.medusajs.com\"\u003e\n**Notice**\nMedusa is under active development, so the content of this post may be outdated. Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\n## **Introduction**\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a front-end UI for Medusa using [Remix](https://remix.run/).\n\nMedusa is an open source ecommerce platform in Node.js that provides you with many ecommerce features such as order management, RMA flows, customer management, and more. Medusa also focuses on providing a good developer experience allowing you to get started within minutes and with a strong support community and documentation to back it up.\n\nRemix is a full-stack web framework that allows you to build slick user interfaces with a resilient user experience. It renders pages on the server, unlike most React frameworks, Remix for ecommerce purposes works extremly well because of this.\n\nFor this tutorial, we'll only focus on the basics which include:\n\n*   Setting up the storefront layout\n\n*   Listing products\n\n*   Displaying a single product page with options\n\nBelow is a snapshot of what we'll be building:\n\n![Remix ecommerce](/images/1.jpeg)\n\nYou can find the complete project in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/brandiqa/remix-medusa-storefront).\n\n## **Prerequisites**\n\nThis article is for intermediate to advanced **React** developers. You need to be familiar with the following:\n\n*   [Remix Blog tutorial](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/blog)\n\n*   [Remix Jokes tutorial](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/jokes)\n\n## **Why Remix**\n\nRemix is a newer React framework that has been quickly gaining popularity in the last couple of years. It's been built by the authors of the popular [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) library.\n\nFor ecommerce, server-based frameworks are recommended in order to provide better search engine optimization capabilities, enhanced API security and faster dynamic pages for end users. Remix for ecommerce has a lot of key advantages including:\n\n*   It renders dynamic content really fast as content processing and third-party API calls are done on the server and not on the client\n\n*   It performs really well on slow networks such as 2G and 3G\n\n*   Remix websites work even if JavaScript is disabled in the browser\n\n*   Build times and performance are not affected by the size of the data\n\n## Why Medusa\n\nMedusa’s headless architecture makes it easier to create a storefront with the language or framework of choice. Whether you choose Remix, Gatsby, Next.js, or any other framework, you can utilize Medusa’s APIs to create a storefront that has all main ecommerce capabilities.\n\nYou can also connect your Medusa server to the [Medusa admin](https://github.com/medusajs/admin) take full power over your ecommerce store. The [Medusa admin](https://demo.medusajs.com/) allows store operators to manage products, orders, customers, discounts, and much more.\n\n## **Medusa Server Setup**\n\nThe first step in this tutorial is to set up a Medusa server where data storage and backend processing are handled. First, install the software locally as follows:\n\n```\n# Install Medusa CLI\nnpm install -g @medusajs/medusa-cli\n\n# Create a new Medusa project\nmedusa new my-medusa-store --seed\n```\n\nThe --seed option adds dummy products to your store as well as some other configuration.\n\n## Set up Medusa Admin\n\nAs mentioned before, Medusa provides a strong admin interface that you can use to manage your store, products, orders, and much more! The admin is easy to install and use, however it is completely optional. So, if you’re not interested in an admin you can skip to the next section.\n\nIn a separate directory, run the following command to install the admin:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/medusajs/admin medusa-admin\n```\n\nThis will create a new directory medusa-admin. Change to that directory and install the dependencies:\n\n```\nnpm install\n```\n\nNow, run the Medusa server from the my-medusa-store directory:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nThen, run your Medusa admin from the medusa-admin directory:\n\n```\nnpm run develop\n```\n\nIf you open localhost:7000 in your browser, you’ll see a login screen. The --seed option you used earlier when you created your Medusa store adds an admin user with the email “admin@medusa-test.com” and password “supersecret”.\n\nThen, from the sidebar, choose Products. You’ll see the list of products available in your store and you can add a new product using the New Product button at the top right.\n\n![Remix ecommerce](/images/2-9afb16e0.png)\n\nIf you click New Product or you click on an existing product to edit it, you’ll be able to enter a lot of information about the product. You’ll also be able to add variants, upload images, and much more.\n\n![Remix ecommerce](/images/3.png)\n\n## **Remix + Tailwind CSS Setup**\n\nIn this section, you’ll quickly create a Remix project and set up Tailwind CSS for rapid UI styling. The UI won’t be fully responsive for the sake of the simplicity of the tutorial.\n\nYou’ll also use JavaScript to write the code, however, I highly recommend using **TypeScript** and a **Test-Driven Development framework** for real-world production frontends.\n\nWe can quickly create our Remix project as follows:\n\n```\nnpx create-remix@latest remix-medusa-storefront\n\n? What type of app do you want to create? Just the basics\n? Where do you want to deploy? Remix App Server\n? TypeScript or JavaScript? JavaScript\n? Do you want me to run `npm install`? (Y/n) Y\n```\n\nAfter installation, navigate to the project folder via terminal and confirm that everything is working by executing the command npm run dev. Check to see that localhost:3000 is loading properly. If everything loads fine, kill the dev server before proceeding to the next step.\n\n![Remix ecommerce](/images/33.jpeg)\n\nNext, with the help of the official [Tailwind CSS Remix integration guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/remix), set up Tailwind CSS in your remix-medusa-storefront project as follows:\n\n**Step 1**: Install package dependencies\n\n```\n# Install Dev packages\nnpm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer concurrently\n\n# Generate `tailwind.config.js` file\nnpx tailwindcss init -p\n```\n\n**Step 2:** Update the content field in tailwind.config.js to configure the files used for [Tailwind CSS purging process](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production).\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  content: [\"./app/**/*.{js,jsx}\"],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {},\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n};\n```\n\n**Step 3:** Change the dev and build scripts in package.json to add the CSS compilation steps:\n\n```\n\"scripts\": {\n\t\t...,\n    \"build\": \"npm run build:css \u0026\u0026 remix build\",\n    \"build:css\": \"tailwindcss -m -i ./styles/app.css -o app/styles/app.css\",\n    \"dev\": \"concurrently \\\"npm run dev:css\\\" \\\"remix dev\\\"\",\n    \"dev:css\": \"tailwindcss -w -i ./styles/app.css -o app/styles/app.css\"\n  },\n```\n\n**Step 4:** Create the file ./styles/app.css at the root of the project with the following content:\n\n```\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n```\n\n**Step 5:** Add this code to app/root.jsx to allow loading of Tailwind's compiled CSS onto the pages:\n\n```\nimport styles from \"~/styles/app.css\";\n\nexport function links() {\n  return [{ rel: \"stylesheet\", href: styles }];\n}\n```\n\n**Step 6:** Test your Tailwind CSS setup by replacing the code in app/routes/index.jsx with the following code:\n\n```\nexport default function Index() {\n  return (\n   \u003cdiv className=\"container mx-auto mt-8\"\u003e\n    \u003ch1 className=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-700 underline\"\u003e\n      Hello world!\n    \u003c/h1\u003e\n   \u003c/div\u003e\n   );\n }\n```\n\nExecute npm run dev and confirm that Tailwind CSS styles are being loaded at the index page on localhost:3000/.\n\n![Remix ecommerce](/images/34.jpeg)\n\nDo note that when you launch your project, whether in dev or build mode, the file /app/styles/app.css gets generated for you based on the source input of ./styles/app.css. Hence, you shouldn't touch the generated file when making CSS customizations.\n\nAdding /app/styles/app.css to .gitignore is a good idea since the file will be generated during the deployment stage.\n\n## **Site Layout**\n\nNow that you have successfully integrated Tailwind CSS in a working Remix ecommerce project, you can proceed with setting up a basic layout for your Storefront. Create the app/layouts folder and create the following files inside this folder:\n\n*   footer.jsx\n\n*   navbar.jsx\n\n*   index.jsx\n\nIn app/layouts/footer.jsx add the following code:\n\n```\nexport default function Footer() {\n  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();\n \n  return (\n   \u003cdiv className=\"py-4 text-sm text-center text-gray-200 bg-gray-800\"\u003e\n    \u0026copy; Copyright {currentYear} [Brand name]. All Rights Reserved\n   \u003c/div\u003e\n   );\n }\n```\n\nThis snippet simply displays *copyright information* in the current year.\n\nFor the **Navbar**, you need to display:\n\n*   Logo\n\n*   Navigation links\n\n*   Shopping cart icon\n\nFor the logo, you can include your own logo or you can copy this [placeholder logo](https://github.com/brandiqa/remix-medusa-storefront/blob/master/public/logo.svg) for now. Rename the filename to logo.svg and place it in the /public directory.\n\nFor navigation links, you’ll use \\[\\\u003cNavLink\u003e]\\(https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/remix#navlink) which is a special kind \\\u003cLink\u003e that knows whether or not the page is the currently loaded page. You’ll need to provide styling for .active CSS class to provide a visual indication.\n\nFor the shopping cart icon, you’ll simply import from the [React Icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons) package. Install as follows:\n\n```\nnpm install react-icons\n```\n\nWith the required resources now set up, you can now proceed with inserting the following code in app/layouts/navbar.jsx\n\n```\nimport { Link, NavLink } from \"@remix-run/react\";\nimport { BiShoppingBag } from \"react-icons/bi\";\n\nexport default function Navbar() {\n const links = [\n   {\n\t   label: \"Home\",\n\t   url: \"/\",\n   },\n   {\n\t   label: \"Products\",\n\t   url: \"/products\",\n   },\n   {\n\t   label: \"About\",\n\t   url: \"/about\",\n   },\n  ];\n\n return (\n  \u003cnav className=\"flex items-center justify-between px-8 pt-2\"\u003e\n    {/* Site Logo */}\n   \u003cdiv className=\"font-mono text-3xl font-extrabold uppercase\"\u003e\n    \u003cLink to=\"/\"\u003e\n     \u003cimg className=\"w-28\" src=\"/logo.svg\" alt=\"Medusa\" /\u003e\n    \u003c/Link\u003e\n   \u003c/div\u003e\n\n    {/* Navigation Links */}\n   \u003cdiv className=\"space-x-4\"\u003e\n     {links.map((link, index) =\u003e (\n     \u003cNavLink key={index} to={link.url} className=\"navlink\"\u003e\n       {link.label}\n     \u003c/NavLink\u003e\n     ))}\n   \u003c/div\u003e\n\n    {/* Shopping Cart Indicator/Checkout Link */}\n   \u003cdiv className=\"font-semibold text-gray-600 hover:text-emerald-500\"\u003e\n    \u003cNavLink\n     to=\"/checkout\"\n     className=\"inline-flex items-center space-x-1 transition-colors duration-300\"\n    \u003e\n     \u003cBiShoppingBag className=\"text-xl\" /\u003e \u003cspan\u003e0\u003c/span\u003e\n    \u003c/NavLink\u003e\n   \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/nav\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\nNext, insert the following code in app/layouts/index.jsx which will be your main site layout:\n\n```\nimport Footer from \"./footer\";\nimport Navbar from \"./navbar\";\n\nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n return (\n  \u003c\u003e\n   \u003cheader className=\"border-b\"\u003e\n    \u003cNavbar /\u003e\n   \u003c/header\u003e\n   \u003cmain className=\"container flex justify-center flex-grow mx-auto\"\u003e\n     {children}\n   \u003c/main\u003e\n   \u003cFooter /\u003e\n  \u003c/\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\nAdd this code to ./styles/app.css after Tailwind’s base styles to include your custom layout and navigation styles:\n\n```\n/*\nLayout styling\n*/\nhtml {\n  @apply antialiased font-sans text-gray-800 bg-gray-200;\n }\n \n body {\n  @apply flex flex-col min-h-screen overflow-x-hidden;\n }\n \n /*\n Typography styling\n */\n \n h1 {\n  @apply text-3xl font-bold;\n }\n \n h2 {\n  @apply text-xl;\n }\n \n p {\n  @apply text-gray-700;\n }\n \n /*\n Navigation menu styling\n */\n \n .navlink {\n  @apply inline-block w-20 py-2 font-semibold text-center text-gray-500 hover:text-emerald-500;\n }\n \n .navlink:after {\n  @apply block pb-2 border-b-2 border-emerald-400 transition ease-in-out duration-300 origin-[0%_50%] content-[\"\"] scale-x-0;\n }\n \n .navlink:hover:after {\n  @apply scale-x-100;\n }\n \n a.active {\n  @apply font-bold text-gray-700;\n }\n```\n\nFinally, replace the entire code in app/root.jsx which includes your new site layout:\n\n```\nimport {\n  Links,\n  LiveReload,\n  Meta,\n  Outlet,\n  Scripts,\n  ScrollRestoration,\n} from \"@remix-run/react\";\n\nimport Layout from \"./layouts\";\nimport styles from \"~/styles/app.css\";\n\nexport function links() {\n  return [{ rel: \"stylesheet\", href: styles }];\n }\n \n export function meta() {\n  return {\n   charset: \"utf-8\",\n   title: \"Medusa Remix StoreFront\",\n   viewport: \"width=device-width,initial-scale=1\",\n   };\n }\n \n export default function App() {\n  return (\n   \u003cDocument\u003e\n    \u003cLayout\u003e\n     \u003cOutlet /\u003e\n     \u003cScrollRestoration /\u003e\n     \u003cScripts /\u003e\n     \u003cLiveReload /\u003e\n    \u003c/Layout\u003e\n   \u003c/Document\u003e\n   );\n }\n \n function Document({ children }) {\n  return (\n   \u003chtml lang=\"en\"\u003e\n    \u003chead\u003e\n     \u003cMeta /\u003e\n     \u003cLinks /\u003e\n    \u003c/head\u003e\n    \u003cbody\u003e{children}\u003c/body\u003e\n   \u003c/html\u003e\n   );\n }\n \n export function ErrorBoundary({ error }) {\n  return (\n   \u003cDocument\u003e\n    \u003cLayout\u003e\n     \u003cdiv className=\"text-red-500\"\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003eError\u003c/h1\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e{error.message}\u003c/p\u003e\n     \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/Layout\u003e\n   \u003c/Document\u003e\n   );\n }\n```\n\nYou can now start the dev server again by running the command npm run dev. Your localhost:3000 index page should now appear similar to the screenshot below:\n\n![Remix ecommerce](/images/4-99647a11.png)\n\n## **Page Routes**\n\nYou’ll now add the products, about, and checkout pages. Create the following files in app/routes folder:\n\n*   products/index.jsx\n\n*   about.jsx\n\n*   checkout.jsx\n\nYou won't implement any logic for this section. You’ll simply place some placeholder code starting with app/routes/products/index.jsx:\n\n```\nexport default function ProductsIndexRoute() {\n  return (\n   \u003cdiv className=\"w-full mt-8\"\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eProducts Page\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eList of products\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003c/div\u003e\n   );\n }\n```\n\nCopy the following final code for app/routes/about.jsx:\n\n```\nexport default function AboutRoute() {\n  return (\n   \u003cdiv className=\"w-full mt-8\"\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eAbout\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cp className=\"mt-4 text-justify\"\u003e\n      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.

Non iure dolore at\n      mollitia.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003c/div\u003e\n   );\n }\n```\n\nCopy the following placeholder code for app/routes/checkout.jsx:\n\n```\nexport default function CheckoutRoute() {\n  return (\n   \u003cdiv className=\"w-full mt-8\"\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eCheckout Page\u003c/h1\u003e\n   \u003c/div\u003e\n   );\n }\n```\n\nFinalize the home page by implementing a simple Hero banner inspired by [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/components/ecommerce/page-examples/storefront-pages). Replace the entire code in app/routes/index.jsx with the following:\n\n```\nimport { Link } from \"@remix-run/react\";\n\nexport default function IndexRoute() {\n return (\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    {/* Hero Banner */}\n   \u003cdiv className=\"px-12 py-32 text-center text-gray-200 bg-gray-800\"\u003e\n    \u003ch1 className=\"text-5xl text-gray-100\"\u003eNew arrivals are here\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cp className=\"px-8 mt-2 font-semibold text-gray-300\"\u003e\n      The new arrivals have, well, newly arrived.

In the next section, you’ll start implementing the logic for the /products route.\n\n## **Products Page**\n\nIn this section, you’ll implement the Products page by pulling data from the Medusa server and in a CSS grid.\n\nFirst, ensure your Medusa Store server is running at localhost:9000. If it's not, you can navigate to Medusa's project folder in the terminal and execute the command npm start. Once it's running, you can proceed to the next step.\n\nComing back to your remix-medusa-storefront project, install the [Medusa JS Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@medusajs/medusa-js) package to provide you with easy access to the Medusa API:\n\n```\nnpm install @medusajs/medusa-js\n```\n\nNext, you need to create a utility that will help you create and access an instance of the medusa-js client. Create the file app/utils/client.js with the following code:\n\n```\nimport Medusa from \"@medusajs/medusa-js\";\n\nconst BACKEND_URL = process.env.PUBLIC_MEDUSA_URL || \"http://localhost:9000\";\n\nexport const createClient = () =\u003e new Medusa({ baseUrl: BACKEND_URL });\n```\n\nNext, open apps/routes/products/index.js and replace with the following:\n\n```\nimport { json } from \"@remix-run/node\";\nimport { useLoaderData } from \"@remix-run/react\";\n\nimport { createClient } from \"~/utils/client\";\n\nexport const loader = async () =\u003e {\n const client = createClient();\n const { products } = await client.products.list();\n return json(products);\n};\n\nexport default function ProductsIndexRoute() {\n const products = useLoaderData();\n\n return (\n  \u003cdiv className=\"w-full mt-8\"\u003e\n   \u003ch1\u003eLatest Arrivals\u003c/h1\u003e\n   \u003cul\u003e\n     {products.map((product) =\u003e (\n     \u003cli key={product.id}\u003e{product.title}\u003c/li\u003e\n     ))}\n   \u003c/ul\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn the above code, you are using Remix's [data loading](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/data-loading) feature to query data from the Medusa server. This data is passed on to the rendering function via the useLoaderData hook. Check out Medusa's [Product API](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store/product) and examine what the JSON structure looks like. You should expect the following output on the /products page:\n\n![Remix ecommerce](/images/6-e1ecbc96.jpeg)\n\nNow that you have the data, you can start building the UI using CSS grids and Product Cards. But first, we need to create a little helper that will display the product's price.\n\nIn Medusa, a product contains multiple variants, and each variant has different prices for multiple currencies.\n\nThe data you seeded earlier when you created the Medusa server contains pricing for USD and EUR for each product variant. Since this is an introductory tutorial that aims to be simple, you’ll not be able to fully implement all the necessary logic for a production app which includes:\n\n*   Auto-detecting users’ region and currency using [geolocation](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5\\_geolocation.asp)\n\n*   Giving users the options for choosing region and currency\n\n*   Displaying product prices based on the selected region/currency\n\nCreate the file app/utils/prices.js and copy the following simplified code:\n\n```\n// TODO: Detect user language\nconst locale = \"en-US\";\n\n// TODO: Detect user currency/Allow currency selection (usd | eur)\nconst regionCurrency = \"usd\";\n\nexport function formatPrice(variant) {\n  const price = variant.prices.find(\n    (price) =\u003e price.currency_code == regionCurrency\n  );\n  return new Intl.NumberFormat(locale, {\n    style: \"currency\",\n    currency: regionCurrency,\n  }).format(price.amount / 100);\n}\n```\n\nThe code above uses hard-coded constants in place of configurable variables.  The function formatPrice accepts a Product Variant as input and returns the price as a formatted String currency.\n\nNext, you’ll need to create the component ProductCard which will display:\n\n*   Thumbnail\n\n*   Title\n\n*   Price (for the 1st variant)\n\nCreate the file app/components/product-card.jsx and copy the following code:\n\n```\nimport { Link } from \"@remix-run/react\";\nimport { formatPrice } from \"~/utils/prices\";\n\nexport default function ProductCard({ product }) {\n const variant = product.variants[0];\n\n return (\n  \u003csection className=\"overflow-hidden bg-white rounded-lg shadow:md hover:shadow-lg w-80\"\u003e\n   \u003cLink to={`/products/${product.id}`}\u003e\n    \u003cimg className=\"w-80\" src={product.thumbnail} alt={product.title} /\u003e\n    \u003cdiv className=\"p-4\"\u003e\n     \u003ch3 className=\"text-lg font-bold text-gray-700 hover:underline\"\u003e\n       {product.title}\n     \u003c/h3\u003e\n     \u003cp className=\"font-semibold text-teal-600\"\u003e{formatPrice(variant)}\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n   \u003c/Link\u003e\n  \u003c/section\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\nFinally update the code in apps/routes/products/index.js as follows:\n\n```\nimport { json } from \"@remix-run/node\";\nimport { useLoaderData } from \"@remix-run/react\";\n\nimport ProductCard from \"~/components/product-card\";\nimport { createClient } from \"~/utils/client\";\n\nexport const loader = async () =\u003e {\n const client = createClient();\n const { products } = await client.products.list();\n return json(products);\n};\n\nexport default function ProductsIndexRoute() {\n const products = useLoaderData();\n\n return (\n  \u003cdiv className=\"w-full p-4 my-8\"\u003e\n   \u003ch1 className=\"text-center\"\u003eLatest Arrivals\u003c/h1\u003e\n   \u003cdiv className=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-6 px-4 mt-8 md:px-12 lg:px-6 xl:px-4 xl:gap-6 2xl:px-24 2xl:gap-6 justify-items-center md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 2xl:grid-cols-4\"\u003e\n     {products.map((product) =\u003e (\n     \u003cProductCard key={product.id} product={product} /\u003e\n     ))}\n   \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\nImplementing these updates should yield the following result:\n\n![Remix ecommerce](/images/7.jpeg)\n\n## **Single Product Page**\n\nTo create a single product page, you need to use the slug file naming convention.

First, you load the single product using the productId route parameter.\n\n```\nimport { json } from \"@remix-run/node\";\nimport { useLoaderData } from \"@remix-run/react\";\n\nimport { createClient } from \"~/utils/client\";\nimport { formatPrice } from \"~/utils/prices\";\n\nexport const loader = async ({ params }) =\u003e {\n const client = createClient();\n const { product } = await client.products.retrieve(params.productId);\n return json(product);\n};\n\nexport default function ProductRoute() {\n  const product = useLoaderData();\n\n  return (\n\t  \u003cdiv className=\"w-full mt-8\"\u003e\n\t   \u003ch1\u003e{product.title}\u003c/h1\u003e\n\t   \u003cp\u003e{formatPrice(variant)}\u003c/p\u003e\n\t   \u003cp\u003e{product.description}\u003c/p\u003e\n\t  \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\nYou should be familiar with this code as it's quite similar to app/components/product-card.jsx. The main difference is that you are using Medusa's client.products.retrieve(id) to retrieve data for a single product.\n\nSecond, you need to give customers the ability to select product variants, which in this case are *sizes*. You can implement this feature with the help of the useState React hook:\n\n```\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function ProductRoute() {\n    const product = useLoaderData();\n    const [variant, setVariant] = useState(product.variants[0]);\n\n\t  const handleVariantChange = (index) =\u003e {\n\t    setVariant(product.variants[index]);\n\t    setQuantity(1);\n\t  };\n\n    return (\n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n           ...\n           \u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t        {product.variants.map((variantItem, index) =\u003e (\n\t\t        \u003cbutton\n\t\t         key={variantItem.id}\n\t\t         onClick={() =\u003e handleVariantChange(index)}\n\t\t        \u003e\n\t\t          {variantItem.title}\n\t\t        \u003c/button\u003e\n\t\t        ))}\n\t\t      \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n    )\n}\n```\n\nThe code above will generate a series of clickable buttons corresponding to each variant that the product has.\n\nThird, you need to give end-users the ability to view different images of the product. Here’s the logic for this feature:\n\n```\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function ProductRoute() {\n    ...\n  const [image, setImage] = useState(product.images[0]);\n\n  const handleImageChange = (id) =\u003e {\n    setImage(product.images.find((img) =\u003e img.id === id));\n  };\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n        ...\n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n          \u003cimg src={image.url} alt={product.title}\n          /\u003e\n          \u003cdiv\u003e\n            {product.images.map((imageItem) =\u003e (\n              \u003cimg\n                className={`w-16 border-2 rounded-lg ${\n                  imageItem.id === image.id ? \"border-teal-400\" : null\n                }`}\n                key={imageItem.id}\n                src={imageItem.url}\n                alt={product.title}\n                onClick={() =\u003e handleImageChange(imageItem.id)}\n              /\u003e\n            ))}\n          \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe snippet above will display a list of clickable thumbnails below the main product image that users can click to switch and view different images of the product.\n\nFourth, you need to provide end-users with a quantity input. You need to validate this input to ensure that:\n\n*   Quantity is not less than 0\n\n*   Quantity is not more than the variant's inventory\n\nHere's the logic for the quantity input:\n\n```\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function ProductRoute() {\n    ...\n  const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);\n\n  const handleQuantityChange = (action) =\u003e {\n    switch (action) {\n      case \"inc\":\n        if (quantity \u003c variant.inventory_quantity) setQuantity(quantity + 1);\n        break;\n\n      case \"dec\":\n        if (quantity \u003e 1) setQuantity(quantity - 1);\n        break;\n\n      default:\n        break;\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n        ...\n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n          \u003cp\u003eSelect Quantity\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n          \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e handleQuantityChange(\"dec\")}\u003e\n            -\n          \u003c/button\u003e\n          \u003cspan\u003e{quantity}\u003c/span\u003e\n          \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e handleQuantityChange(\"inc\")}\u003e\n            +\n          \u003c/button\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe + and - buttons will allow users to increment or decrement the desired quantities of a particular variant. The function handleQuantityChange performs the validation for this input.\n\nNow that you have understood the different logic sections of a Single Product page, let’s see what the completed page looks like in the browser:\n\n![Remix ecommerce](/images/8.jpeg)\n\nYou should be able to select variants (size), thumbnails and set the quantity. Make sure every product page is loading without errors.\n\n## What’s Next\n\nThere are more important ecommerce functionalities that you still need to implement. Those include checkout, payment, shipping, and customer accounts, among other features.\n\nYou can check out the [Medusa documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start) for more details on how you can go forward including:\n\n*   [How to Add Plugins](https://docs.medusajs.com/guides/plugins). You can also check the [list of plugins](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/tree/master/packages) available in Medusa:\n\n*   Add payment methods like [Stripe](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/stripe).\n\n*   Add [custom shipping methods](https://docs.medusajs.com/guides/fulfillment-api).\n\n*   Add product search using [Algolia](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/algolia).\n\nSince this Remix ecommerce storefront currently doesn't have all features out of box you can use on of the others that Medusa has such as, [Next.js](https://dev.to/medusajs/create-your-open-source-ecommerce-store-using-medusa-and-nextjs-1b4d) and [Gatsby](https://dev.to/medusajs/create-an-open-source-ecommerce-store-with-gatsby-and-medusa-2h6b) storefronts. These storefronts include functionalities like customer accounts, product listings, cart management, and full checkout workflow.\n\nShould you have any issues or questions related to Medusa, then feel free to reach out to the Medusa team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp).

There are so many platforms, services, and frameworks that use a headless architecture. An example of this is Medusa, a headless commerce platform.\n\nBut what is headless, really? And why is it becoming a trend?\n\nIn this article, I’ll simplify the meaning of “headless” as much as possible. I’ll also go over some of the benefits of headless architecture and some of the popular headless trends.\n\n## What is Headless\n\nThe formal explanation of a Headless architecture is the decoupling of the frontend and the backend. But what does that actually mean?\n\n### Real-life Example\n\nLet’s take PlayStation (or any other console you prefer) as an example. When you buy a PlayStation, you buy the console or device that allows you to play games, handles your storage and settings, and more.\n\nHowever, you’re free to connect it to whatever monitor or TV you want. You just need the correct cable that works for both your monitor and PlayStation, and you’ll be able to see the games and play them.\n\nA headless server is the PlayStation console in this example. It holds all logic needed to perform certain functionalities and store and manage data. That’s its main focus. It’s not concerned with how these functionalities and data are presented to the user.\n\nA headless server then exposes a set of APIs to get access to the server’s functionalities and data. Think of the APIs like the HDMI port in a PlayStation.\n\nThe APIs are designed in a way that’s optimal for the server. It’s not concerned with who or what is using them. Those who want to use it will simply have to follow its design to allow the user to perform the functionalities provided by the server or present data to the user.\n\n### What it Really Means\n\nTraditional monolithic architecture tightly binds the frontend to the backend. This means that any backend decision can affect or be limited by the frontend, and vice-versa.\n\nThe headless architecture removes the binding between the two components. A backend should focus on processing and handling logic and data only. It’s concern shouldn’t be how to present it to the user.\n\nSimilarly, the frontend should focus on how to provide a good web design and user experience. It should allow the user to be able to perform a set of functionalities and interact with the data in an intuitive way.\n\nThis separation can be done by making sure the backend exposes well-designed APIs that the frontend can use to provide an graphical interface to the user. Whether the frontend is a website or an app, it should be able to access the backend just the same.\n\n## Why Use a Headless Architecture\n\nA headless architecture provides a lot of advantages for both the backend and frontend. To keep it simple here are some advantages for each:\n\n### Backend\n\n*   You have more freedom in designing APIs or the internal architecture and logic. This removes a lot of hacky solutions that developers used to run into previously.\n\n*   Your backend will be more scalable and you can integrate it with third-party services hassle-free.\n\n*   Your backend is more secure as the user will be interacting with the frontend and as the backend and frontend are generally hosted separately.\n\n### Frontend\n\n*   You have more freedom in what framework, device, or programming language you use. You can use frameworks like Gatsby to create faster static websites.\n\n*   You can focus on the design and user experience of the front end without being weighed down by the backend.\n\n*   You can reduce costs on hosting your frontend as there are more flexible solutions for the frontend on its own rather than a tightly-knit frontend and backend.\n\n## **Popular Headless Trends Explained**\n\nCurrently, the most popular headless trends are headless Content Management Systems (CMS) and headless commerce.\n\nThese 2 concepts are gaining popularity as they bring so much power to developers and systems as a whole.\n\n### Headless CMS\n\nA headless CMS is a CMS that allows you to manage content without worrying about how or what is going to present the content. This allows you to integrate CMS into any system or website of your own just by calling the APIs that the headless CMS exposes. An example of this is [Strapi](https://strapi.io/about-us) or [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/about-us/).\n\n### Headless Commerce\n\nHeadless commerce is a platform that provides all basic checkout functionalities through its APIs. You can then build the storefront that the user interacts with using any framework you want or for any device. An example of this is Medusa.\n\nYou can also seamlessly integrate a headless CMS like Strapi with a headless Commerce like Medusa for an ecommerce platform with rich CMS features.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA headless architecture leads to a better developer experience, highly scalable applications, and better performant websites.

You can host Medusa’s server on any of your preferred hosting choices, and one way to host it is using [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/).\n\nAWS Elastic Beanstalk is a service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with many programming languages and frameworks including Node.js.\n\nThrough this guide, you will learn how to create a simple pipeline with AWS CodePipeline that pulls your Medusa’s server code from a GitHub repository and automatically deploy it to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.\n\n## Why Elastic Beanstalk?\n\nUsing Elastic Beanstalk you will be able to deploy a Medusa server application within the AWS Cloud. You just deploy your application and Elastic Beanstalk mechanically handles the main points of capability provisioning, load equalization, scaling and application health observance.\n\nOnce you deploy your application, Elastic Beanstalk builds the chosen supported platform version and provisions all the AWS resources like AmazonEC2 instances or Databases that your application needs to run.\n\nSo, in a nut shell, AWS Elastic Beanstalk makes it easy for developers to deploy their applications and share them with the world.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo follow along with this tutorial you need the following:\n\n*   A working Medusa server application. You can follow the [quickstart guide to get started](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start).\n*   [A GitHub account.](https://github.com)\n*   An AWS Account with an IAM user, you can check [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) how to create one. Be sure your IAM user has the sufficient permissions to interact with Elastic Beanstalk, you can check more info about that [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/AWSHowTo.iam.managed-policies.html).\n\n***\n\n## Set up a Node environment on Elastic Beanstalk\n\nThe first step is to create a Node.js environment on Elastic Beanstalk with a sample application. Later on you’ll replace the sample app with the Medusa server.\n\nGo to AWS sign in page and login with your IAM user. You’ll be redirected to the Console Home page.\n\n![AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s0fuy01r76qsdj5f4yyh.png)\n\nOnce you are here, go to the top search bar and write `Elastic Beanstalk`; in the results choose the first option.\n\n![AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ktyhz9f87khzfrengvs3.png)\n\nThat will lead you to AWS Elastic Beanstalk Dashboard page, where you will have to click on the `Create application` button.\n\n![AWS Elastic Beanstalk home page](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ut73t0gexzx6dhfnnojl.png)\n\nYou can use “Create Web app” console wizard to create your sample application.\n\n1.  Specify your Elastic Beanstalk application name information, for this tutorial the name is `aws-medusa-server`.\n2.  Click on Platform drop-down and select the Node.js platform. At the time this article was written, the *platform branch* selected was `Node.js 16 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2`, and the *platform version* was `5.5.0`.\n3.  Select the Sample Application as application code.\n4.  Click on **Configure more options** and go to the **Capacity** section. Once you are there click on edit.\n5.  On the **Modify capacity** page go to **instances types** and choose `t2.small` and `t2.medium`, then click on **save**.\n\n\u003e ⚠️ This step is very important because by default the instances type are `t2.micro` and `t2.small`, however the `micro` instance has only 1 Gb of RAM. This is enough for testing and development, but we recommend going with a larger instance for a production environment.\n\n1.  Back in the **Configure more options** page, go to the **Database** section and click on edit. Here you are going to set up the PostgreSQL database needed for the medusa server. The suggested configuration is to choose **postgres** as engine with version 10, 11 or 12. You’ll also need to enter a username and password. Make sure to save those for later as you’ll use them. Once you’re done, click on Save.\n2.  Last, click on “**Create App**“ button. It will take few minutes to launch your application.\n\nOnce the environment is created you can go to the overview page and check Environment Health, application running version and application platform version where application is running on.\n\n![AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uyrxovjst8twyy5p3bb3.png)\n\nOn top of this page you will see the environment’s URL below the environment name, click on this URL to get to the sample application’s congratulations page.\n\n![AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/na9nkp92251p4lyfyjpz.png)\n\nUntil this point you should have a Node environment running on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with a sample application, the next step is to prepare the medusa server to be deploy on this environment.\n\n***\n\n## Preparing Medusa server\n\nTo create the pipeline for CI/CD you need to do some changes on your medusa server repository and push them to GitHub.\n\nFirst, in your Medusa server, open your `package.json` file and add the following property at the end\n\n```\n\"engines\": {\n  \"node\": \"\u003e=16.0.0\"\n}\n```\n\nBe careful: the `node version` must match the version that you set when creating the environment. AWS Elastic Beanstalk will search for this before deploying your app with AWS CodePipeline, so, if you don’t do this, then the deployment will fail.\n\nIn this file, you also need to change the start command to the following:\n\n```\n\"start\": \"medusa migrations run \u0026\u0026 medusa develop -p=8080\",\n```\n\nBasically, what you are doing is changing the port on which the medusa server run by default, so, instead of running on port `9000` it will run on port `8080`. The main reason to do this is because by default AWS Beanstalk run `ngix` as reverse proxy to redirect all the incoming traffic from the internet on port 80 to port 8080.\n\nAlso, it is necessary to run migrations on the server before running the Medusa server.\n\nThe next step is to add a `Procfile` to the root of your project with the next line of code\n\n```\nweb: npm run start\n```\n\nThis instructs AWS Beanstalk on how to run your application once all the dependencies are installed with `npm install`, first it will run the medusa migrations, and then it will start the app.\n\nThe last thing you need to do is make sure you’ve set your Database to use PostgreSQL. In `medusa-config.js`, make the following changes in the exported object:\n\n```\ndatabase_url: DATABASE_URL,\natabase_type: \"postgres\",\n// database_database: \"./medusa-db.sql\",\n// database_type: \"sqlite\",\n```\n\nWhen all these changes are done, commit and push them to your remote repository on GitHub.\n\nOnce the repository is ready on GitHub, the next step is to create an AWS CodePipeline.\n\n***\n\n## Add environment properties\n\nTo create the pipeline, you need to set some environment variables on your node environment on AWS Beanstalk. This is because when you finish setting up the code pipeline, it will be triggered immediately and it will do the first deployment. So, to get an OK status all the env variables needed by the Medusa server need to be set in advance.\n\nOn the overview page of AWS Beanstalk, go to the left pane and search for the configuration menu of your node environment and click on it.\n\n![AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aqdwydw3soi7phoi5w3p.png)\n\nThen click on the Edit button next to Software.\n\n![AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ktu6rmf0gd3iik3me0rq.png)\n\nIn the **Modify software** page go to the last section called **Environment properties** and add the following properties\n\n```\nNPM_USE_PRODUCTION=false\nJWT_SECRET=something\nCOOKIE_SECRET=something\nDATABASE_URL=postgres://\u003c\u003cUSERNAME\u003e\u003e:\u003c\u003cPASSWORD\u003e\u003e@\u003c\u003cDATABASE_URL\u003e\u003e:5432/\u003c\u003cDB_NAME\u003e\u003e\n```\n\n![AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cl63h2gjl6bu4rnof387.png)\n\nPay special attention to the first and last properties. The first property is to allow AWS Beanstalk to install the dependencies (babel) needed to run the command `medusa develop`.\n\nThe last one is the URL to connect to the database. Here, you need to change `\u003c\u003cUSERNAME\u003e` and `\u003c\u003cPASSWORD\u003e\u003e` with the ones you set when creating the node environment.\n\nAs for `\u003c\u003cDB_NAME\u003e\u003e` and `\u003c\u003cDB_URL\u003e\u003e` you can find those by searching for “RDS” in your AWS Console. Then click on Databases in the sidebar. You should see a PostgreSQL database.\n\n![AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zyh1y0syxh18wdq52hdm.png)\n\nClick on the DB identifier and scroll down to Connectivity \u0026 Security. The URL under Endpoint is your `\u003c\u003cDB_URL\u003e\u003e`. As for `\u003c\u003cDB_NAME\u003e\u003e` , you can find it under the Configuration tab. By default, it’s `ebdb`.\n\nAfter adding the environment variables, click on Apply and wait until the environment is updated with this changes. Once the update is complete, you can now go on and create the CodePipeline.\n\n***\n\n## Set up AWS CodePipeline\n\nThe goal of the pipeline is to listen for changes or commits on the main branch of your Medusa server’s repository on GitHub. When this happen the pipeline will be triggered and it will starts a new deployment to update your application on AWS Beanstalk.\n\nMake sure that before continuing with this step you’ve created a repository for your Medusa server.\n\nGo to the top search bar and write CodePipeline in the results choose the first option\n\n![AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9i6zncz7w4vqbac41qvu.png)\n\nOn CodePipeline dashboard page click on the button “**Create Pipeline**”.\n\n\u003e ⚠️ Make sure that your are in the same region where is your node environment.\n\n![AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5bvchnd8it1v4epnw43e.png)\n\nOn the **Choose pipeline settings** page, give a name to the pipeline and leave everything as it is and click on the Next button. For this tutorial, the name will be `aws-medusa-server-pipeline`.\n\n![AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8niz2c5xfuzwkh7iypxn.png)\n\nOn the **Add source stage** page, under *Source Provider* dropdown choose GitHub (Version 2). Then, If you have not created a GitHub connection, click on “**Connect to GitHub**” button to grant permission to AWS CodePipeline to access your Medusa server repository on GitHub. This will help AWS Code Pipeline to upload your committed changes from GitHub to AWS CodePipeline.\n\nOnce you’ve connected GitHub, choose your repository and the branch from where you will be pulling your application.\n\nCheck the option that says ***Start the pipeline on source code change*** and for the **Output artifact format option** choose “CodePipeline default”. Click on the Next button.\n\n![AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ehlbiq88t21thituzkdt.png)\n\nOn the **Add build stage** page, you will click on the `Skip build stage` button.\n\n![AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tc9c6lvgrsl3h12o3kpw.png)\n\n![AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/u7nyfi3lfww0umzr8uny.png)\n\nOn the **Add deploy stage** page, under *Deploy provider* dropdown, select “AWS Elastic Beanstalk”, then choose the region your node environment is in and the application and environment you created earlier (in the case of this tutorial these are `aws-medusa-server` and `Awsmedusaserver-env` respectively) Once you’re done, click on the Next button.\n\n![AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/uok7gdvwnw7iqjuxmfjd.png)\n\nOn the **Review** page, check that everything is fine. Then, click on the `Create pipeline` button.\n\nYou will see a success message banner displayed, and the pipeline actions will be running until they are completed. If everything went fine, both stages will be marked with a checkmark success.\n\n![AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/65mmiacmzdf12qupgszw.png)\n\n## Test it Out\n\nTo check that your Medusa server is working, go back to the Elastic Beanstalk dashboard and search for the environment’s URL below the environment name, then do the following:\n\n*   Copy the URL.\n*   Open a new tab in your browser, paste the URL and add at the final `/health`, so the URL would something like this:\n\n`http://awsmedusaserver-env.eba-kkrjvcxb.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/health`\n\nYou should get an `OK` message, if that is the case, then you have successfully deployed your Medusa server into AWS Elastic Beanstalk.\n\n![AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/80ty9h4r0q0sjwu0m151.png)\n\n\u003e 💡 Make sure to change the URL in your Medusa storefront or admin based on the URL of your server.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you run into any issues or there’s a problem with your deployed server, you can check the logs in your Elastic Beanstalk instance by clicking on Logs in the sidebar.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDeploying a Medusa server on AWS Elastic Beanstalk is easier with the help of CI/CD pipelines. Once you’re done, you can focus on adding new functionality to your Medusa server as custom endpoints, services or plugins.\n\nThen, to push the changes to your server you can just push them to your GitHub repository. The configured pipeline will detect changes and start execution. Your application will then be updated with the new features.\n\nTo learn more about how to customize your store or how you can connect a storefront to your store, be sure to check out [Medusa’s documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com).\n\nIf you have any issues or questions related to Medusa, then feel free to reach out to the Medusa team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp).\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/shopify-vs-open-source.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/shopify-vs-open-source.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/shopify-vs-open-source.md"},"title":"Shopify Vs.

In this article, we will shed some light on how an open source ecommerce platform like Medusa compares to a proprietary alternative like [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/about).\n\nShopify is one of the most popular platforms worldwide to create ecommerce stores. Its simplicity attracts a lot of merchants and businesses who don’t want to dabble in the technical details of creating an ecommerce store and want to start selling their products quickly.\n\nOn the other hand, [Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) is an open source headless commerce platform built with an abstraction-based architecture that makes it more extendible and easier to customize.\n\nMedusa is built for developers and is focused on providing a great developer experience with its architecture, ease of setup, supporting community, and strong documentation. Although less than a year old, Medusa is already used in production by merchants selling globally.\n\n![shopify vs. open source](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m0sil7c0mlsa89iyzewo.jpg)\n\n## Overall logic: Shopify vs. Open source ecommerce\n\nAs time pass and as businesses grow they discover that Shopify’s approach to making your store setup simple comes at a price. They start facing complications related to expanding their market, adding integrations, and customizing their store to their needs, among other issues. This locks in developers and leads them to build hacky workarounds to achieve the business needs.\n\nWhen comparing Shopify vs. open source projects like Medusa, some of the main distinctions are simplicity and extendibility which are kept in mind. Not only is it easy to set up and start selling, but it’s also easily customizable based on your business need.\n\nSo, even if your business grows with time and you’ll need to add new integrations, customize the storefront, or make any other aspect your own, you can do it with Medusa hassle-free.\n\nIt should be noted as well that Medusa needs to be set up and managed by developers, given that it’ll be an easy task for them. So, if your business requires a solution with no developers to manage and maintain the store, then Medusa wouldn’t be a great fit in this case.\n\n## Architecture: Shopify vs. Open source ecommerce\n\n### Commerce backend\n\nMedusa is in essence an open source headless commerce backend. Medusa has a similar set of core ecommerce features as Shopify. These include payment and checkout flow, cart functionality, fulfillment flow, shipping options, customer profiles (e.g. for customer-specific pricing), advanced promotions (e.g. discounts and gift cards), product and stock management, etc...\n\nMoreover, all settings related to payment and shipping providers are region-based along with product pricing which can be specified per region. For a full feature list, check out [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#features).\n\nPerhaps one of the most important reasons to choose Medusa is its abstraction-based architecture built for easy customization and maintainability. Medusa allows you to customize and compose your store specifically to suit each individual use case.\n\nIts abstraction layers and open-source nature enable developers to pick up Medusa and change around the core setup to fit their use case or build directly upon Medusa’s APIs to extend functionalities.\n\nIn Shopify’s case, most of its features and pros rely on its simplicity. Shopify is a feature-rich platform that comes with a lot of out-of-the-box features that you can use in your store. It’s also easy to navigate for people with no-technical knowledge, allowing them to be in full control of their store and make any high-level changes to their store.\n\nThe simplicity bound in the monolithic architecture likewise becomes the weakness when comparing Shopify vs open source platforms. It is great to get started with, but more rigid to make changes to.\n\nFor instance, as the backend is proprietary it is difficult to make large changes or revert opinionated implementations when beneficial. When changes need to be made in a monolithic system it will often be accomplished through more “hacky” workarounds since the nature of the architecture is not meant to be changed.\n\n### Backend admin panel\n\nWhen comparing Shopify vs. open source ecommerce platforms like Medusa it’s important to mention the admin panel. Both Shopify and Medusa come with an out-of-the-box admin panel that is easy to use for non-technical store managers. However, there are some differences in features.\n\nFor instance, Medusa provides built-in flows for claims, returns, and exchange flows allowing end-users to self-serve for this part. On the other hand, Shopify provides built-in support for sales analytics and marketing which Medusa does not.\n\nOverall, Shopify has a more feature-stuffed admin panel making it more convenient to get started with. However, Medusa’s strength again comes in its extendibility, as such the admin panel has no structural limits.\n\nThe core idea of the Medusa Admin panel is to give a lean solution that is easy to administer. For adjacent services such as sales, analytics, and marketing it is encouraged that you build it custom yourself or leverage integrations to outside solutions specialized in these services.\n\nBecause of the composable architecture behind the Medusa engine, this functionality is more easily added and customized in the Medusa admin panel.\n\n### Frontend\n\nAs Shopify is easy to set up with its themed solutions, it has a great starter package with an abundance of themes that can be used. There are options for free templates that can be tweaked slightly to one’s liking. They also offer an option for merchants to pay for more advanced themes which can lead to some extra personalization for the storefront.\n\nHowever, due to Shopify’s monolithic nature developers are limited in terms of adding custom functionalities or completely customizing the storefront. Therefore, Shopify provides another option: Shopify plus (starting at 2,000$/month). It permits developers to go headless through their Hydrogen setup where developing custom storefronts is possible.\n\nAs Shopify was originally built with a monolithic setup, its plugins are devised in a way to facilitate both the frontend and the backend. When moving from a monolithic to a headless system with Shopify there is an inclined risk of breaking these plugins.\n\nRegarding frontend development, there are several differences between Shopify vs. open source headless solutions. Since Medusa is built as an open source ecommerce headless setup the frontend and the backend are decoupled, and the storefront functionality and design can be customized without interfering with the backend. This also permits the developer to construct with any frontend framework of their choice.\n\nThere are 2 available storefronts you can use with your Medusa server, one created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) and one using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/about/). You can also create your own storefront using any framework of your choice by interacting with Medusa’s REST APIs.\n\nSince changes can be made to the frontend without disrupting the backend, your frontend development will be quicker. This also allows for a higher degree of personalization and flexibility when designing the storefront.\n\n### Payment\n\nA clear benefit of using Medusa is the flexibility in choosing your payment solutions. Off the bat, Medusa integrates with several payment systems such as Stripe, Klarna, Adyen, and PayPal. Since Medusa is open source, you can also easily extend its payment API to integrate with any payment solution of your preference.\n\nShopify Payments is the main payment solution that is available through Shopify. They restrict access to other third-party payment solutions by charging merchants transaction fees when using other parties.\n\nDepending on the specific Shopify plan, shop owners are charged a fee between 0.5% and 2% when using third-party payment gateways. Currently, Shopify Payments is only available in [17 countries/territories](https://www.stylefactoryproductions.com/blog/shopify-review). Users that are not selling from these countries have to incur these extra transactions costs.\n\nIn other words, a significant distinction between Shopify vs. open source is the ability to get full control over how one wants to use and integrate payment systems.\n\n### Fulfillment, Analytics, and Other Integrations\n\nShopify provides users with an app store containing over 7,000 different third-party applications that users can integrate with their store. This gives merchants the ability to add functionalities to their website through the app store.\n\nHowever, it also comes with a downside. Often you’ll need to add multiple apps from the app store to implement all the different features you need. This can clutter your store and will make it hard for developers managing a store to maintain and keep track of all the apps. This is especially trying knowing that Shopify often [cleans up their store and removes apps](https://community.shopify.com/c/announcements/103-apps-are-no-longer-available-on-shopify-details-and/td-p/1137940), leaving merchants in need to find alternative apps to use.\n\nOn the other hand, comparing Shopify vs. open source projects like Medusa, the architecture is designed to facilitate integrations and custom developments while making sure they are easy to maintain afterward.\n\nIt’s possible to add endpoints, services, and event handlers (or subscribers) into Medusa seamlessly. Also, as you have full ownership of the entire tech stack, you are free to mold it and shape it as it fits your use case.\n\nYou can likewise leverage plugins created by the community as well, for instance, [the Medusa extender](https://github.com/adrien2p/medusa-extender) facilitating multi-vendor support.\n\nMedusa also supports a range of third-party integrations out of the box, including CMS ([Contentful](https://www.medusajs.com/post/how-to-connect-medusa-and-contentful) \u0026 [Strapi](https://www.medusajs.com/post/open-source-headless-commerce-and-cms)), payment (e.g. [Stripe](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/stripe/), [Paypal](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/paypal/)), marketing (e.g. SendGrid and S3), search ([Algolia](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/algolia/) \u0026 [Meilisearch](https://www.medusajs.com/post/meilisearch-and-medusa)), analytics (e.g. [Segment](https://www.medusajs.com/post/segment-medusa)), and many more.\n\n## Conclusion: Shopify vs. Open source ecommerce\n\nBoth Medusa and Shopify have their perks and make a good choice for different use cases.\n\nWhen to choose Shopify:\n\n*   Merchants with no-technical knowledge looking to create their ecommerce store.\n\n*   Businesses that “just want to get started quickly” with an easy solution to set up\n\n*   Businesses that are looking for a simple setup with limited customizations to it\n\nWhen to choose Medusa:\n\n*   Developers that want full control over the ecommerce platform’s codebase, integrations, and customizations.\n\n*   Businesses that are looking for a scalable platform where they can own the entire user experience and avoid re-platforming down the road\n\n*   Businesses that were anyway considering building an ecommerce solution from scratch, but prefer a solid starting point\n\n‍\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/vue-ecommerce-platform.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/vue-ecommerce-platform.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/vue-ecommerce-platform.md"},"title":"How to Build a Nuxt.js Storefront Ecommerce With Medusa","date":"2022-03-01","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/Medusa 7-8ed73f85.webp","altText":"Vue ecommerce platform","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"type":"PostLayout","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-oh4qb9784.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-oh4qb9784.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-oh4qb9784.json"},"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Padilla","role":"Role","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/Carlos.webp","altText":"Person photo"},"type":"Person"}],"excerpt":"Build a business ecommerce storefront with a Nuxt.js starter and  integrate it into your Medusa server.

Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\n## Introduction\n\nMedusa is an open source headless commerce engine in Node.js that allows you to build online stores through its API with just a few commands - link to [repo](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa). On the other hand, [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/get-started/installation) is a front-end framework, built on top of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html), that includes some features out-of-the-box such as server-side rendered sites, static sites, file system routing, data fetching, meta tags, SEO, and much more.\n\nThrough this guide, you will learn how to set up a starter storefront with Nuxt.js for the frontend part and link it with a Medusa server. To do that, first, you will create a Nuxt.js project and set up some simple components, pages and layout. Then, you will link the Nuxt.js project with the Medusa server to get some products from the API and display them on the home page, a product's page, and a product detail page.\n\nYou can find the final code at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/carpad88/nuxtjs-starter-medusa).\n\nIf you have any problems underway in the setup, please reach out in the [Medusa Discord](https://discord.com/invite/medusajs).\n\n![Vue ecommerce platform](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rnnnfd2ya2wnu77fm5he.png)\n\n![Vue ecommerce platform](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4lf19pzrfvfjiaz02fky.png)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo follow along with this tutorial you need the following:\n\n*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/), it is recommended to have the latest LTS version installed.\n*   One of the following package managers installed: `npm`, `yarn`, or `npx` (included by default with `npm` v5.2+).\n*   A Medusa server is seeded with some dummy data to work with, so if this is not the case, please first read the [QuickStart guide](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start) to set up a Medusa server and after that come back to continue.\n\n## Setting up the storefront\n\n\u003e ⚠️ This tutorial uses **Nuxt v2.15.8** because at the time of writing this article there are two versions of Nuxt, but the newer one (Nuxt v3) is yet in beta state.\n\n### Install a Nuxt.js project\n\nTo install a Nuxt project, you can get started quickly with `create-nuxt-app`. Open your terminal and run the following command\n\n```\n// npx create-nuxt-app \u003cproject-name\u003e\nnpx create-nuxt-app nuxtjs-storefront\n```\n\nIt will ask you some questions. You can choose the options that best fit your development workflow, but to keep this tutorial simple, I recommend installing the project using the following options:\n\n![Vue ecommerce platform](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vr5lpbmut2egnppnqo4u.png)\n\n### Run Nuxt.js project\n\nOnce the Nuxt.js project is created, change to the directory of the storefront\n\n```\ncd nuxtjs-storefront\n```\n\nAnd then run the following command\n\n```\nyarn dev\n```\n\nThis command will run the storefront app by default at `http://localhost:3000`. To test it, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You will get something like this:\n\n![Vue ecommerce platform](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dwh3tyuc0388ly4pethm.png)\n\nLater on, you will change the default port to learn how to integrate your frontend with the Medusa server in a port that is not the default.\n\n## Make the storefront layout\n\nBefore you go into connecting the Medusa server with the storefront, you need to add some components and pages to the storefront. Open the storefront’s project in your preferred IDE.\n\nYou should see the following directories:\n\n![Vue ecommerce platform](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xd2n14woflo5eyzgnx7a.png)\n\nYou will be focusing mainly on the `components` and `pages` directories to design the layout for the storefront.\n\n### Components\n\nComponents are what make up the different parts of your page. They can be reused and imported into your pages, layouts, and even other components.\n\nThe storefront you are creating will have the following components:\n\n*   Logo\n*   Navbar\n*   Footer\n*   Product card\n\nGo to the `components` directory and delete the default components that come with the Nuxt.js installation. Then add the following files\n\n**Logo →** `components/App/Logo.vue`\n\n```\n\u003ctemplate\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"h-16 flex items-center\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"ml-4 flex lg:ml-0

For this tutorial you will need only 3 pages:\n\n*   Home page\n*   Products page\n*   Product detail page\n\nOn the `pages` directories, open the `index.vue` file and replace the code that is already there with this one\n\n**Index →** `/pages/index.vue`\n\n```\n    \u003ctemplate\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\n        \u003cdiv class=\"bg-ui-light pb-12 lg:pb-0 w-full px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-12\"\u003e\n          \u003cdiv class=\"flex flex-col lg:flex-row items-center max-w-screen-2xl mx-auto\"\u003e\n            \u003cdiv class=\"w-auto h-full object-center object-cover p-12\"\u003e\n              \u003cimg\n                width=\"600\"\n                alt=\"\"\n                src=\"https://start.medusajs.com/static/9803c162c71fd1960d9d11253859c701/246b5/hero-merch.webp\"\n              \u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003cdiv\u003e\n              \u003ch1 class=\"text-4xl\"\u003e\n                CLAIM YOUR MERCH\n              \u003c/h1\u003e\n              \u003cp class=\"mt-2 text-lg font-normal\"\u003e\n                Contribute to Medusa and receive free merch\u003cbr\u003eas a token of our appreciation\n              \u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cbutton class=\"btn-ui mt-4 min-w-full lg:min-w-0\"\u003e\n                Learn more\n              \u003c/button\u003e\n            \u003c/div\u003e\n          \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n\n        \u003cdiv\n          v-if=\"products.length\"\n          class=\"container mx-auto px-8 py-16\"\n        \u003e\n          \u003cdiv class=\"flex items-center justify-between mb-6\"\u003e\n            \u003cp class=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700\"\u003e\n              Featured\n            \u003c/p\u003e\n            \u003cnuxt-link\n              class=\"text-ui-dark flex items-center\"\n              to=\"/products\"\n            \u003e\n              \u003cspan class=\"mr-2 text-ui-dark\"\u003eBrowse all products\u003c/span\u003e\n              \u003csvg\n                width=\"16\"\n                height=\"8\"\n                viewBox=\"0 0 16 8\"\n                fill=\"none\"\n                xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n              \u003e\n                \u003cpath d=\"M15.3536 4.35355C15.5488 4.15829 15.5488 3.84171 15.3536 3.64645L12.1716 0.464466C11.9763 0.269204 11.6597 0.269204 11.4645 0.464466C11.2692 0.659728 11.2692 0.976311 11.4645 1.17157L14.2929 4L11.4645 6.82843C11.2692 7.02369 11.2692 7.34027 11.4645 7.53553C11.6597 7.7308 11.9763 7.7308 12.1716 7.53553L15.3536 4.35355ZM0 4.5H15V3.5H0V4.5Z\" fill=\"#89959C\" /\u003e\n              \u003c/svg\u003e\n            \u003c/nuxt-link\u003e\n          \u003c/div\u003e\n          \u003cdiv class=\"grid grid-cols-4 gap-8\"\u003e\n            \u003cProductCard\n              v-for=\"product in products\"\n              :key=\"product.id\"\n              :item=\"product\"\n            /\u003e\n          \u003c/div\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/template\u003e\n\n    \u003cscript\u003e\n    export default {\n      name: 'IndexPage',\n    \tdata () {\n        return {\n          products: [{\n            id: 1,\n            title: 'Kitchen Table',\n            thumbnail: 'https://picsum.photos/600/600',\n            variants: [{ prices: [{ amount: 0, currency_code: 'usd' }] }]\n          }]\n        }\n      },\n    }\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n\n    \u003cstyle\u003e\n      .btn-ui {\n        @apply py-2 px-4 bg-ui-dark text-white text-sm font-medium rounded-md shadow;\n        @apply focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ui-dark focus:ring-opacity-75 disabled:bg-ui-medium;\n      }\n    \u003c/style\u003e\n```\n\nThis page will be the home for your storefront. It is composed of a hero header and a grid configured to show only four products. The only thing to do here once you connect the storefront to the Medusa server will be to put the `ProductCard` component in a `v-for` loop to display the products.\n\nNow, you need to create a new directory called `products` which will hold inside the **products page** `/pages/products/index.vue` and the **product detail page** `/pages/products/_id.vue`. Add the following code to these pages.\n\n**Products page →** `/pages/products/index.vue`\n\n```\n\u003ctemplate\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"container mx-auto p-8\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"w-full border-b border-ui-medium pb-6 mb-2 lg:mb-6 flex items-center justify-between\"\u003e\n      \u003ch1 class=\"font-semibold text-3xl\"\u003e\n        All Products\n      \u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n    \u003cdiv\n      v-if=\"products.length\"\n      class=\"grid grid-cols-4 gap-8 \"\n    \u003e\n      \u003cProductCard\n        v-for=\"product in products\"\n        :key=\"product.id\"\n        :item=\"product\"\n      /\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/template\u003e\n\n\u003cscript\u003e\nexport default {\n  name: 'ProductsIndex',\n\tdata () {\n    return {\n      products: [{\n        id: 1,\n        title: 'Kitchen Table',\n        thumbnail: 'https://picsum.photos/600/600',\n        variants: [{ prices: [{ amount: 0, currency_code: 'usd' }] }]\n      }]\n    }\n  },\n}\n\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nThis page is similar to the home page but without the hero header.

Once you connect the storefront with the Medusa server, the data coming from the server will replace the data in the `product` object.\n\n### Layouts\n\nLayouts are a great help when you want to have a basic structure for your Nuxt app. For example, to include a navbar and footer that will be shown on all the pages of the app. By default, a Nuxt project doesn't come with layouts, but it is easy to add them to your project.\n\nTo have a default layout on your storefront, create a `layouts` directory in the root of the project, and inside it, add a new file called `default.vue` with the following code:\n\n```\n\u003ctemplate\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"min-h-screen flex flex-col\"\u003e\n    \u003capp-navbar /\u003e\n\n    \u003cmain class=\"flex-1\"\u003e\n      \u003cNuxt /\u003e\n    \u003c/main\u003e\n\n    \u003capp-footer /\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/template\u003e\n\n\u003cscript\u003e\nexport default {\n  name: 'DefaultLayout'\n}\n\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nBecause the layout file was named `default.vue`, the layout will automatically be applied to all the pages on the storefront.\n\n### Styling\n\nReplace the content of `windi.config.ts` in the root of your Nuxt.js project with the following:\n\n```\nimport { defineConfig } from '@windicss/plugin-utils'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  /**\n   * Write windi classes in html attributes.\n   * @see https://windicss.org/features/attributify.html\n   */\n  attributify: true,\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      fontSize: {\n        '2xs': '0.5rem'\n      },\n      maxWidth: {\n        '1/4': '25%',\n        '1/2': '50%',\n        '3/4': '75%'\n      },\n      maxHeight: {\n        review: 'calc(100vh - 10rem)'\n      },\n      boxShadow: {\n        DEFAULT:\n          '0 2px 5px 0 rgba(60, 66, 87, 0.08), 0 0 0 1px rgba(60, 66, 87, 0.16), 0 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)',\n        error:\n          '0 2px 5px 0 rgba(255, 155, 155, 0.08), 0 0 0 1px rgba(255, 155, 155, 0.70), 0 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)'\n      },\n      colors: {\n        green: {\n          DEFAULT: '#56FBB1'\n        },\n        blue: {\n          DEFAULT: '#0A3149'\n        },\n        ui: {\n          light: '#F7F7FA',\n          DEFAULT: '#EEF0F5',\n          medium: '#D9DFE8',\n          dark: '#89959C'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n### Change the Default Port\n\nNow, you will change the port where the storefront app runs by default (port 3000). To do that, open the `nuxt.config.js` file and add the following right after the `ssr` property\n\n```\nserver: {\n  port: 3333\n},\n```\n\nAfter that, run the following command to see in the browser what you have achieved with the components, pages, and layout that you just set up until this part of the tutorial.\n\n```\nyarn dev\n```\n\nOpen your browser and go to the URL `localhost:3000`. You should see something like this:\n\n![Vue ecommerce platform](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/k0sotieyjtdos2je691r.gif)\n\nThe storefront just shows static data for now. You will link the storefront with the Medusa server in the next section.\n\n## Link Medusa server with storefront\n\nTo link the server with the storefront, first, open up your Medusa project in your IDE, then open the `.env` file where all your environment variables are set up.\n\nAdd the variable `STORE_CORS` with the value of the URL where your storefront will be running. Remember that you changed the default port on the storefront, therefore the URL is `http://localhost:3333`.\n\n```\nSTORE_CORS=http://localhost:3333\n```\n\nAfter this, your Medusa server will be ready to receive a request from your storefront and send back responses if everything works as expected.\n\n\u003e ⚠️ The medusa server is running by default in port 9000, so the URL to use on the storefront to send requests is `http://localhost:9000`.\n\n### Testing connection with Medusa server\n\nTo be able to list the products on the home page you need to test if you can send requests from your storefront to the Medusa server and receive some data to show on the front-end.\n\n\u003e ⚠️ Be sure the `@nuxtjs/axios` module is installed in your storefront project. If it’s not, then you need to install it following [these instructions](https://axios.nuxtjs.org/setup).\n\nOnce the project has the `axios` module, you need to change the base URL for the `axios` module that you’ll use to make the requests to the server.\n\nOpen the `nuxt.config.js` file and look for the `axios` property. Change the `baseURL` property to match the URL where the medusa server will be running:\n\n```\naxios: {\n  baseURL: 'http://localhost:9000/'\n},\n```\n\nWith this change, you don’t have to type the full URL each time you need to make an HTTP request to the Medusa server. So, instead of this:\n\n```\n$axios.$get('http://localhost:9000/store/products')\n```\n\nYou will do this:\n\n```\n$axios.$get('/store/products')\n```\n\nIf the server URL changes in the future, you only need to come back to one place and update that just one time, and everything will be working fine.\n\nTo fetch data from the API, this tutorial uses [the `fetch`](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/features/data-fetching) function that Nuxt.js offers as part of the core.\n\nOpen the file `/pages/index.vue` and add the `fetch` function in the `script` section:\n\n```\nasync fetch () {\n    try {\n      const { products } = await this.$axios.$get('/store/products')\n\t\t\tconsole.log(products)\n      this.products = products\n    } catch (e) {\n      // eslint-disable-next-line no-console\n      console.log('The server is not responding')\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nThis function receives just one parameter `$axios` which is a service that allows making an HTTP request to the Medusa server. So, inside the function, a request is sent to the endpoint `/store/products` to obtain the list of products from the Medusa server. Then, the list of products is returned.\n\nTo test this out, run the following command in the terminal to start the medusa server:\n\n```\nmedusa develop\n```\n\nAnd start the storefront server:\n\n```\nyarn dev\n```\n\nOpen your browser and go to the URL `localhost:3000`. Then, open the `Web Developer Tools.`\n\nIf you find something like this in the console tab then your connection to the Medusa server is working. Otherwise, check that you follow all the steps and are not missing anything.\n\n![Vue ecommerce platform](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8pkiwq6rtqmkg2cgxhob.png)\n\n\u003e 🧠 Remember, the URL where your storefront app is running has to be the same that was set up on `STORE_CORS` variable on the medusa server.\n\n### Display Products on the Home Page\n\nNow is time to render the `products` result returned from the Medusa server on the storefront.\n\nIn the same file `/pages/index.vue`, update the `fetch` function to the following,\n\n```\nasync fetch () {\n\ttry {\n\t\tconst { products } = await this.$axios.$get('/store/products')\n\t\tthis.products = products.splice(0, 4)\n\t} catch(e) {\n\t\t// eslint-disable-next-line no-console\n\t\tconsole.log('The server is not responding')\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith this update, the data coming back from the server replaces the `products` array with only four products to display on the homepage.\n\nThe `v-for` applied on the `ProductCard` iterates the `products` array and passes to the component, as a `prop`, a product with all the [properties specified on the Medusa API](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store/product) for that endpoint.\n\nIf you check the storefront on the browser it should look something like this:\n\n![Vue ecommerce platform](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/i73hpdeblmmjm0lmujwy.png)\n\n### Display Products on The Products Page\n\nIn the navigation bar, there is a “Products” link. If you click on it, you will be redirected to the **products page**, but there will be only one static product. Let’s fix that to display all the products in your Medusa server on the page.\n\nOpen the `/pages/products/index.vue` file, go to the `script` section and add the following `fetch` function\n\n```\nasync fetch () {\n  try {\n    const { products } = await this.$axios.$get('/store/products')\n    this.products = products\n  } catch (e) {\n    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console\n    console.log('The server is not responding')\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCheck the products page in your browser and you should get something like this:\n\n![Vue ecommerce platform](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2xgaje9vtk7787y6jaj0.png)\n\n### Display Product Details\n\nThe last page to update is the **product detail page**. If you click on any product on the **home page** or the **products page**, it will take you to the product’s details page, but you won’t see any details at all. To fix it, you need to request a specific product to the Medusa server so you can get all the product info.\n\nOpen the file `/pages/products/_id.vue` and add the following `fetch` function\n\n```\naasync fetch () {\n  try {\n    const { product } = await this.$axios.$get(`/store/products/${this.$route.params.id}`)\n    this.product = product\n    this.imageToShow = this.product.images[0].id\n  } catch (e) {\n    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console\n    console.log('The server is not responding')\n  }\n},\n```\n\nIf you go again to your browser and click on any product, you will be taken to the product details page like before, but this time you’ll see all details rendered on the page.\n\n![Vue ecommerce platform](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nzuta8q8cgtxd2vlzbyl.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs you learned in this tutorial it is very easy to make a storefront from zero with Nuxt.js and integrate it with your Medusa server.\n\nThe next steps for you would be to check the [Medusa API](https://docs.medusajs.com/api) to learn about all the different requests that you can call from your storefront to turn your Nuxt.js storefront into a full-fledged online store.\n\nFor example, you can implement the Cart functionality. The process would involve making the pages or components on the Nuxt.js app and then making the respective requests to the Medusa server to get the data to render on the storefront.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about our Next.js based Medusa storefront, then check out our [Next Starter template](https://medusajs.com/nextjs-commerce/).\n\nShould you have any issues or questions related to Medusa, then feel free to reach out to the Medusa team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp).\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/medusa-express-ecommerce.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/medusa-express-ecommerce.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/medusa-express-ecommerce.md"},"title":"Introducing Medusa.express: The easiest way to set up an ecommerce store","date":"2022-02-14","excerpt":"Medusa.express is an open source one-page checkout flow used to simplify the purchasing experience for the end-user","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/Medusa 3-19fa1e52.webp","altText":"Post thumbnail image","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"type":"PostLayout","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-x7i0ls6ji.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-x7i0ls6ji.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-x7i0ls6ji.json"},"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Rindom","image":{"url":"/images/Seb.jpeg","altText":"Person photo"},"type":"Person"}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json"},"name":"Product","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"\n[medusa.express](http://medusa.express) automatically creates pages for the products in your catalog, each of them optimized to make the purchasing experience as frictionless as possible, by bundling the checkout flow alongside the product.\n\nThe underlying thesis is that not all customers and not all products benefit from a fully-fledged website experience. Consider three different examples:\n\n- **Retargeting:** Customers in the lowest part of the marketing funnel, say customers who have already shown an interest for a given product. Why not give these customers a super quick way to purchase your products.\n- **Complex purchases:** Consider stores with huge product catalogs where customers need guidance (algorithmic or human powered) to find the desired product - once the right product has been determined the goal becomes to complete the transaction both from the store’s and the customer’s perspective.\n- **Simple store owners:** Some people simply do not need a full store setup to sell their products; bloggers, one-item sellers or outbound salespeople might be sufficiently served by sending a link to their users for purchasing certain products while not having to maintain a full webshop frontend.\n\n## How it works\n\n1. A customer visits a link e.g. https://medusa.express/basic-tshirt\n2. The customer selects the variant of the product they wish to buy\n3. Customer completes the checkout flow and the order is completed\n\n![Medusa Express Workflow](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ib6p03hazrdm9ju45r2b.gif)\n\n## Why did we build this concept?\n\nOne of the most liberating things about using a headless commerce engine, like Medusa, is that you are not constrained to follow any standards around how the shopping experience should be for your products. Standards are great in most cases, but they do also sometimes limit what is possible and therefore hinders you from opportunities if the standards are too tightly coupled with your software.\n\nYou are surely familiar with the standard 2-column product grid, that serves as entry points to a product page with an image on the left side a size and quantity ticker on the right side, which ultimately have the goal of taking you to a checkout flow that looks the same across all brands. This experience has not changed much over the past many years and a likely reason for this is that companies still treat their digital commerce channels as physical retail stores.\n\nIn physical retail stores, all customers are directed through the same path and products are placed along this path in a way that is meant to optimize the stores sales as carefully planned by a retail merchandiser. The same approach has been taken for digital commerce experiences to the point where even the most advanced personalization engines for ecommerce rarely offer solutions different from placing candy and chocolates along side each other in a supermarket does.\n\nWhat is yet to be leveraged is the fact that the internet enables an infinite amount of purchasing experiences to be offered and [medusa.express](http://medusa.express) is a simplified demo that illustrates how headless commerce can make this possible.\n\n## Try it now!\n\n**Prerequisites**: To use Medusa Express, you are required to have a running Medusa server.

Please check out our documentation instead.\n\u003c/callout\u003e\n\n\nIn this article, I will show you how to migrate _all_ of your products and collections from a Shopify backend to an open-source headless commerce backend, [Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa), in less than 10 minutes.\n\nMedusa is an open-source Shopify alternative giving you all of the necessary primitives to build and operate a webshop. Below, I will first walk you through the features of Medusa. Then I’ll move on to a guide on how to use the plugin to quickly import your Shopify products and collections into Medusa. Finally, I’ll go into a bit more depth on some of the reasons why you should consider moving from Shopify to an open-source headless platform.\n\n## Why Use Medusa\n\nAs [Medusa](https://www.medusajs.com/) is an open-source headless commerce platform, it allows you to completely customize and compose your stack to fit your needs. You’re not bound to a monolithic architecture where everything is tightly coupled. Some of the main benefits of this are:\n\n1.  It gives you full flexibility to build any type of frontend(s) you may prefer - Medusa has starters in [Next.js](https://github.com/medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa) or [Gatsby](https://github.com/medusajs/gatsby-starter-medusa) to set up a high-performing storefront out-of-the-box so you have a good starting point before starting to customize it to your needs. You can check out a demo of the starer [here](https://start.medusajs.com/).\n2.  The open-source nature lets you customize the core engine to cater to more advanced business cases and requirements that are often outside the scope of monolithic platforms. The code-base is meant to be extendible and customizable which you can feel from the very first time you try to add own functionality to it.\n3.  Medusa's plugin architecture makes it intuitive and easy to manage your integrations, switch providers and grow with ease. It even comes with a lot of pre-made integrations to CMSs, payments, shipping, analytics, marketing and more. You can check them all out [here](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/tree/master/packages).\n4.  Also on features, Medusa provides a few different additions that makes it stand out such as the option to define regional currency, shipping and payment options which is one of the more known issues for business owners running on Shopify and wants to sell across markets. Another example is return, exchange and claim handling which are all fully-automated processes in Medusa that makes it easy to use for customer service personnel.\n\nThere are therefore many reasons to migrate from a monolithic solution like Shopify to a headless open source solution. In the next session, we will walk through how easy this type of migration process can be.\n\n## How to Migrate Data from Shopify to Medusa\n\nIn this section of the article, you’ll learn how to use Medusa’s plugin to import your products and collections from Shopify into Medusa.\n\nThis section assumes you already have a Shopify store up and running with products to import. It also assumes you already have Medusa set up and ready to use. If you don’t, then you should check out [this tutorial on how you can set up and run Medusa](https://dev.to/medusajs/get-started-with-medusa-the-open-source-alternative-to-shopify-305j).\n\nIn my case, I have 30 products in my Shopify store, each having many variants and attributes.\n\n![Shopify migration](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/300bdvqcbijncqiey56z.png)\n\n![Shopify migration](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yqbkrpjqik5jzbz9shi3.png)\n\n### Create a Private Shopify App\n\nTo be able to import the data from Shopify into Medusa, you need to create an App in your store with limited permissions. This will give you different types of keys to access the App and the data in the store.\n\nOpen your store’s dashboard. Then, choose _Apps_ from the sidebar. Then, scroll down and click on _Manage private apps_.\n\n![Shopify migration](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0jlrvewzvqalgmizuio0.png)\n\nIf you haven’t enabled private apps previously, you’ll be asked to enable them first. click on _Enable private app development_ to enable it.\n\nAfter you have enable private app development, you’ll be able to create a private app. Click on _Create private app_ to get started.\n\n![Shopify migration](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dcvh7ttgilvxnhadhzoh.png)\n\nYou’ll then need to enter your app’s name and your email. Then, scroll down to the Admin API section and click on _Show inactive Admin API permissions_. Scroll down to Products and choose Read Access from the dropdown. Medusa only needs to read products and collections.\n\n![Shopify migration](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4hcjlolm3xwrj1ghkfn3.png)\n\nScroll down to the end of the page and click the _Save_ button. Then, click _Create App_ in the pop-up that shows up.\n\nAfter you create the app, you’ll be able to see a set of keys such as API Key and Password. What you’ll need for the plugin is the password, so keep it available for the next step.\n\n### Add medusa-source-shopify to your Medusa store\n\nYou’ll now integrate the [Shopify plugin](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/tree/ec0f2df2854d497f49ce94f74636723f0c0e2e26/packages/medusa-source-shopify) into your Medusa server. To integrate the plugin, you need the following:\n\n1.  The Shopify domain name and the password of the Shopify app you want to link to.\n2.  PostgreSQL database used with your Medusa server.\n\nAt this point of the article, it’s assumed you have all of these requirements ready.\n\nOpen your terminal in your Medusa server installation and run the following command to install the plugin:\n\n```\n    npm i medusa-source-shopify\n```\n\nThen, in `.env` add the following new variables:\n\n```\n    SHOPIFY_DOMAIN=\n    SHOPIFY_PASSWORD=\n```\n\nWhere `SHOPIFY_DOMAIN` is the subdomain name of your Shopify store (for example, my store is shahednasser.myshopify.com, so the value would be shahednasser), and `SHOPIFY_PASSWORD` is the password generated when you created the app earlier.\n\nThen, open `medusa-config.js` and add a new entry into the `plugins` array:\n\n```\n    const plugins = [\n      ...,\n      {\n        resolve: 'medusa-source-shopify',\n        options: {\n          domain: process.env.SHOPIFY_DOMAIN,\n          password: process.env.SHOPIFY_PASSWORD\n        }\n      }\n    ];\n```\n\nThis will add the Shopify plugin into your Medusa server and will pass the options for the domain and password from the environment variables you just added.\n\nAnd that’s all you need to integrate Medusa with Shopify to import your data. All you need to do now is run your server:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nAnd the server will import all the products and collections from Shopify into your Medusa store. Your server will do that everytime you start it, so your products and collections will be automatically synced on server restart.\n\nYour products and collections will be imported with pricing, variants, and all the attributes and details you had in your Shopify store.\n\n![Shopify migration](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e5m1t857zaur5t8s389d.png)\n\n## Why Migrate From Shopify to an Open Source backend\n\nAccording to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/shop/Shopify), there are over 3.7M live websites that use Shopify at the time of writing this. This makes Shopify one of the most used ecommerce platforms. Shopify is known to provide an easy experience for brands and businesses of any size to launch and operate their online business.\n\nAlthough Shopify has a lot of advantages that make businesses and developers gravitate towards it, it all comes at the expense of _less ownership of the tech stack_. At first glance, especially for smaller businesses that are just looking to start a store as soon as possible, it may seem like an irrelevant detail.\n\nHowever, any business that have expanded from a few sales a week to becoming a serious ecommerce business can tell how important it is to be able to fully own the tech stack behind your webshop. Owning your website’s codebase, and having the flexibility to change and reform it based on your growing business needs is an important detail that will come up as time passes by. Shifting integrations, opening up new markets, customizing the UX are just some of the areas in which developers encounter problems when scaling with a monolithic platforms.\n\nIn addition to the issues related to scaling, using an open-source solution means that the platform you’re using is free forever. Using Shopify comes at a high price that grows as you scale as it is often directly linked to your webshop revenue and transaction volume. This will add to the additional costs of creating and operating your system.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nShopify is a powerful ecommerce platform that is used by millions of websites across the globe. Although it has a ton of great features, it has some disadvantages as well, most notably your tech stack ownership.\n\nWith ecommerce platforms like Medusa you can completely own your tech stack and have many of the features you like about Shopify into your own open-source store. Medusa even makes it easier by allowing you to import your data from Shopify into Medusa using this easy-to-use plugin.\n\nShould you have any issues or questions related to Medusa, then feel free to reach out to the Medusa team via [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp).\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/hacktober.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/hacktober.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/hacktober.md"},"title":"Hacktober 2021 results","date":"2021-11-01","excerpt":"With Hacktober coming to an end, we would like to take a moment to appreciate the overwhelming support and contributions we've seen the past month","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/Medusa 12.jpeg","altText":"Post thumbnail image","caption":""},"mainPost":true,"type":"PostLayout","colors":"colors-a","actions":[{"type":"Button","label":"Get Started","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa#-quickstart","style":"primary"},{"type":"Link","label":"Request Demo","url":"http://ky5eo2x1u81.typeform.com/to/OtbNv3tx?typeform"}],"social":[{"type":"Social","altText":"GitHub","label":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com/medusajs/medusa","icon":"github"},{"type":"Social","altText":"LinkedIn","label":"LinkedIn","url":"http://www.linkedin.com/company/72061201/","icon":"linkedin"}],"authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-xfh1qg9ch.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-xfh1qg9ch.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-xfh1qg9ch.json"},"firstName":"Vadim","lastName":"Smirnov","bio":"With over 10 years in both public and private sectors, Johnna has experience in management consultation, team building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.","image":{"url":"/images/Vadim.webp","altText":"Person photo"},"type":"Person"}],"category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-29bs7fo47.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-29bs7fo47.json"},"type":"Category","name":"Community"},"markdown_content":"\nWith Hacktober coming to an end, we would like to take a moment to appreciate the overwhelming support and contributions we've seen the past month.

This post and the implementation discussed here are inspired by [this article](https://brandur.org/idempotency-keys) by Brandur.\n\n## What is idempotency?\n\nIdempotence is a mathematical term used to describe algebraic expressions that remain invariant when raised to a natural power - the word itself comes from the Latin words *idem* and *potence* meaning *same* and *power* respectively. In software and tech idempotency typically refers to the idea that you can perform an operation multiple times without triggering any side effects more than once. This is an extremely powerful property for fault tolerance in larger systems where service availability cannot be guaranteed. If you are familiar with RESTful design you have probably heard that `DELETE` requests should be idempotent, meaning that no matter how many times you make a `DELETE` request on a certain resource it should always respond with confirmation that the resource has been deleted (unless business rules don't allow it that is).\n\nIn fintech applications, idempotency is typically extended to other types of requests to ensure that sensitive operations like issuing money transfers, etc. don't erroneously get duplicated. For example, Stripe has support for idempotency on all of their requests controlled by an `Idempotency-Key` header. This allows you to safely retry requests if necessary, for example, you may be issuing an \"Authorize Payment\", but just after the request is sent your internet experiences an outage and you have no way of knowing whether the payment was successfully authorized or not; however, by using idempotency keys you can safely retry the \"Authorize Payment\" request without having to worry about making two payment authorizations.\n\nOne of the major benefits of headless commerce is that you can pick and choose the tools in your stack and have them integrate with each other for a best in breed stack; however, the more systems that are connected the more prone you will be to having inconsistencies across your tools, e.g. because of things out of your control such as server outages, connectivity issues or other unexpected situations. To solve this issue Medusa implements idempotency key support so that you can safely retry requests until consistency is confirmed.\n\n## How can idempotency keys be used?\n\nThere are two perspectives worth considering when answering the question of how idempotency keys can be used: one is from a client perspective, for example, when calling an API from a frontend, the other is from a server perspective when transferring data between systems. The purpose is the same in both circumstances, namely to ensure that an operation is completed correctly.\n\n### Client perspective\n\nImagine that you are adding a line item to a shopping cart through an API like Medusa's. You make a request to add the line item, but right after sending the request your internet drops resulting in a \"Server not reachable\" response - at this time it is not clear whether the request made it to the server and that the underlying database was able to successfully update your cart with the new item or if the internet dropped before sending the request and thus didn't result in an update in the backend. In the former case, a retry would result in your cart now having two items instead of one as expected, so if you retry the request you will have to have a compensating mechanism, which is tricky and tedious to build and test.\n\n*A typical retry flow*\n![Retry Flow for failed API requests](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/grrg7wu30bpkdekitn66.png)\n\nThis is where idempotency keys come in handy as they can help you ensure that the intended state is reached even in fragile environments. In practice the requests would look something like this:\n\n```\nconst idempotencyKey = uuidv4()\n\nconst makeRequest = async () =\u003e {\n  return await api.post(\"/store/carts/[cart-id]/items\", {\n    variant_id: variant.id,\n    quantity: 1\n  }, {\n    headers: {\n      \"Idempotency-Key\": idempotencyKey\n    }\n  })\n}\n\nlet result\nlet shouldRetry = true\nwhile (shouldRetry) {\n  const { response, error } = await makeRequest()\n  if (error) {\n    shouldRetry = shouldRetry(response) // retry logic\n    if (shouldRetry) {\n      // expontential back-off\n    }\n  } else {\n    shouldRetry = false\n    result = response\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNotice that it is the same idempotency key that is being passed across all retries. This indicates to the backend: \"Hey, I am only interested in this operation happening once - can you please check if the operation has already succeeded. If so just respond with the result of the succeeded operation, otherwise, perform the operation now and store the result under this key so subsequent requests with the same key don't perform the operation multiple times\".\n\n### Server perspective\n\nNow, shifting to the server perspective, imagine that you are integrating your commerce API with a payment provider like Stripe and you need to allow your API's consumers to be able to issue refunds. You both have to keep track of the refunds in your system but will also have to call Stripe's API to make sure that the refund of the money goes through to the customer's bank account. Consider what steps your backend would have to take when handling a refund request - you may come up with something along the lines of this:\n\n1.  Validate that the requested amount can be refunded (i.e. less than the original payment for the order minus what has already been refunded).\n2.  Create a record of the refund in your database.\n3.  Issue refund through the Stripe API.\n4.  Store Stripe refund id in the internal record of refund.\n5.  Dispatch job to send a refund confirmation email to the customer\n6.  Complete request and respond\n\nA naive implementation would just execute each of the steps and hope for the best, but that would be a bad idea. Consider what would happen in a case where a server experiences an outage and you have to decide whether to retry the request or not - you don't know which of the steps failed so it is unclear whether the Stripe request has been processed; if it has a new request would duplicate the refund which is obviously bad. Alternatively, if the Stripe request hasn't been processed you may have stale data in your internal database.\n\nA slightly better approach would be to wrap everything into an ACID transaction and roll back if something fails. This way you don't end up having records in your database if something fails unexpectedly; however, in the case of an error you are still left in the dark as to whether the Stripe request was successfully processed or not; so how might you safely retry your failed request? Luckily, Stripe has support for idempotency keys so if your implementation makes sure to forward the idempotency key to Stripe you can safely retry your request without having to worry about refunding the requested amount more than once; however, it is not all external systems that have support for idempotency keys and under such circumstances, you need to take additional measures for your requests to be idempotent. You will see how this can be accomplished through atomic phases shortly.\n\n## Idempotency Key implementation in Expressjs\n\nThe outline here will reveal how to implement idempotency keys in a NodeJS application with Express. It is assumed that the underlying database for the application is an ACID-compliant relational database like Postgresql. Before going further it should be clarified what exactly is meant by an *idempotency key* in this context: an idempotency key is a string that identifies a database entity that tracks the progress of an API request. By tracking the progress, idempotency keys can either pick up where previously failed requests left off or if a previous request succeeded they can be used to return a cached result of the request.\n\nBuilding further on the idea of a Cart API, consider the API request needed to transform a Cart into an Order. The steps to take will be something like the following:\n\n![Create order request steps](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kw06iorth7vlz2vpy22m.png)\n\nConsider the steps in the above request and what your system state and your payment providers state will have recorded in each of the failure points. You may consider each of them and find the following:\n\n### Failure point #1\n\nYou have created a record of the incoming request, but have failed to authorize the payment and no order has been created. You can safely retry the request.\n\n### Failure point #2\n\nThe payment has successfully been authorized and a record of the payment is stored. The order has not been created. If you retry the request now you will be authorizing the payment again - this may fail or worse authorize a new payment duplicating the payment from the previous request. Unless some compensation mechanism has been implemented in your authorization logic that checks for a previous payment it is generally not safe to retry the request.\n\n### Failure point #3\n\nAt this point you have both authorized the payment and created an order in your system. Retrying the request may result in both a duplicate order and a duplicate payment authorization.\n\nNow consider what will happen if you wrap your entire request in a transaction that rolls back after each of the failure points. For failure point 1 you can safely retry, but rolling back at failure point 2 and 3 will result in your own state and the external state of the payment provider being out of sync. Namely the payment provider will have a payment that your internal system has no record of. In order to overcome this problem you must be able to recover from failed requests depending on whether the external system mutation has been completed or not. In simple terms a request retry should be able to say: \"If the payment was already authorized skip that step and continue with creating the order. If the payment wasn't authorized do that now and continue\". The points in the request lifetime where you wish to be able to retry from will be called recovery points in the following discussion.\n\n### Atomic phases\n\nBetween each recovery point you will complete an atomic phase, which is a set of operations that happen within a transaction. If one of the operations fail you will roll back the atomic phase and a retry of the request can then pick up from the recovery point that came before the atomic phase. Considering the request lifecycle above once again, you should realize that you will want 3 atomic phases. One before the payment authorization when the idempotency key is created, one containing the payment authorization and one after the payment authorization has been completed. The diagram below illustrates the atomic phases and each of the recovery points:\n\n![Atomically phased request with recovery points](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5pxtm8ce7gl8ux0josur.png)\n\nRetrying failed requests will now pick up from the most recently reached recovery point meaning that new requests will either skip the payment authorization or retry it if it failed, but will never duplicate it.\n\nNow that you have a rough idea about the parts of the system that you will need to keep track of it is time to look at how you might implement this starting with a simplified database schema.\n\n```\nIdempotencyKey\n- id\n- idempotency_key\n- request_path\n- request_params\n- response_code\n- response_body\n- recovery_point\n\nPayment\n- id\n- payment_provider\n- idempotency_key\n- amount\n\nCart\n- id\n- items\n- completed_at\n\nOrder\n- id\n- items\n- payment_id\n```\n\nNote that the idempotency key entity notes which path and which parameters an API call is requesting. It also has fields for the response code and body to send after the API call has succeeded so that retries of completed requests can skip directly to the response.\n\nTo make atomic phases easy to work with consider the implementation below from Medusa's IdempotencyKeyService.\n\n```\nasync workStage(idempotencyKey, func) {\n    try {\n      return await this.transaction(async (manager) =\u003e {\n        let key\n\n        const { recovery_point, response_code, response_body } = await func(\n          manager\n        )\n\n        if (recovery_point) {\n          key = await this.update(idempotencyKey, {\n            recovery_point,\n          })\n        } else {\n          key = await this.update(idempotencyKey, {\n            recovery_point: \"finished\",\n            response_body,\n            response_code,\n          })\n        }\n\n        return { key }\n      }, \"SERIALIZABLE\")\n    } catch (err) {\n      return { error: err }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n[The `IdempotencyKeyService` in Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/blob/master/packages/medusa/src/services/idempotency-key.js) allows you to execute an atomic phase by using the service method called `workStage`, which takes an `idempotencyKey` string and a `func` function containing the operations to be executed inside the atomic phase. The function can return either a `recovery_point` string in which case the idempotency key's recovery point is updated to that value or alternatively a `response_body` and `response_code` in which case it is assumed that the operation is completed and we can allow the recovery point to be updated to \"finished\".\n\n### API controller implementation\n\nNow it is time to implement the API controller that takes in the [request to create an order](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/blob/master/packages/medusa/src/api/routes/store/carts/complete-cart.js) from a cart. Below you are using a state machine pattern to step through each of the API request's atomic phases.\n\nNotice that the first step in the implementation is to upsert the idempotency key: either by using a provided token in the `Idempotency-Key` header or alternatively by creating a new one at random (this happens in `initializeRequest`).\n\nOnce the idempotency key is retrieved the request moves into the state machine where the recovery point of the idempotency key determines which atomic phase should be executed first. If the most recent recovery point is `\"started\"` the request moves to authorization of the payment, if that has already been completed the request goes straight to creating the order.\n\nThe code snippet below is a simplified version of Medusa's request handler.\n\n```\nexport default async (req, res) =\u003e {\n  const { id } = req.params\n\n  const idempotencyKeyService = req.scope.resolve(\"idempotencyKeyService\")\n  const cartService = req.scope.resolve(\"cartService\")\n  const orderService = req.scope.resolve(\"orderService\")\n\n  const headerKey = req.get(\"Idempotency-Key\") || \"\"\n\n  let idempotencyKey\n  try {\n    idempotencyKey = await idempotencyKeyService.initializeRequest(\n      headerKey,\n      req.method,\n      req.params,\n      req.path\n    )\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(409).send(\"Failed to create idempotency key\")\n    return\n  }\n\n  res.setHeader(\"Access-Control-Expose-Headers\", \"Idempotency-Key\")\n  res.setHeader(\"Idempotency-Key\", idempotencyKey.idempotency_key)\n\n  let inProgress = true\n  let err = false\n\n  while (inProgress) {\n    switch (idempotencyKey.recovery_point) {\n      case \"started\": {\n        const { key, error } = await idempotencyKeyService.workStage(\n          idempotencyKey.idempotency_key,\n          async (manager) =\u003e {\n            let cart = await cartService.withTransaction(manager).retrieve(id)\n\n            if (cart.completed_at) {\n              return {\n                response_code: 409,\n                response_body: {\n                  code: MedusaError.Codes.CART_INCOMPATIBLE_STATE,\n                  message: \"Cart has already been completed\",\n                  type: MedusaError.Types.NOT_ALLOWED,\n                },\n              }\n            }\n\n            cart = await cartService\n              .withTransaction(manager)\n              .authorizePayment(id, {\n                ...req.request_context,\n                idempotency_key: idempotencyKey.idempotency_key,\n              })\n\n            return {\n              recovery_point: \"payment_authorized\",\n            }\n          }\n        )\n\n        if (error) {\n          inProgress = false\n          err = error\n        } else {\n          idempotencyKey = key\n        }\n        break\n      }\n\n      case \"payment_authorized\": {\n        const { key, error } = await idempotencyKeyService.workStage(\n          idempotencyKey.idempotency_key,\n          async (manager) =\u003e {\n            const cart = await cartService\n              .withTransaction(manager)\n              .retrieve(id, {\n                select: [\"total\"],\n                relations: [\"payment\", \"payment_sessions\"],\n              })\n\n            const order = await orderService\n              .withTransaction(manager)\n              .createFromCart(cart.id)\n\n            return {\n              response_code: 200,\n              response_body: { data: order, type: \"order\" },\n            }\n          }\n        )\n\n        if (error) {\n          inProgress = false\n          err = error\n        } else {\n          idempotencyKey = key\n        }\n        break\n      }\n\n      case \"finished\": {\n        inProgress = false\n        break\n      }\n\n      default:\n        idempotencyKey = await idempotencyKeyService.update(\n          idempotencyKey.idempotency_key,\n          {\n            recovery_point: \"finished\",\n            response_code: 500,\n            response_body: { message: \"Unknown recovery point\" },\n          }\n        )\n        break\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (err) {\n    throw err\n  }\n\n  res.status(idempotencyKey.response_code).json(idempotencyKey.response_body)\n}\n```\n\nNotice how unexpected errors are bubbled out to the application controller - it is assumed that your Express app has an error boundary, that handles the error properly. Expected errors that are definitive, that is no matter how many calls you make it should always result in the same error code, which can be stored in the idempotency key so that subsequent requests can short circuit and send the cached response directly.\n\nUsing this pattern across your API endpoints will improve the robustness of your API by making it safe to retry all requests. This is useful for requests that modify the internal state alone, but the concept is especially powerful when dealing with requests that modify external states outside the control of your system. The key to making requests like these safe is to wrap external state modifications in atomic phases and allow retries to pick up both before or after such modifications, depending on the progress made from previous requests.\n\n## Idempotency in Medusa\n\nIn Medusa idempotency has so far been implemented for a handful of API requests, and support is continually being added to more endpoints. The goal is to support idempotency keys for all state-mutating requests so that you can be certain that retrying your requests is safe and harmless. The next step for Medusa will be to add idempotency patterns into the plugin APIs so that Medusa's core can implement self-healing logic that identifies and resolves inconsistencies between systems in your e-commerce stack. This will be a major improvement for the developer experience related to building headless commerce solutions, where there are lots of moving parts and hence lots of potential points of failure.\n\n## What's next?\n\nIf you wish to dive deeper into how idempotency keys are implemented in Medusa visit the [Medusa GitHub repository](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa).

We are so excited to finally open up about what it is we have built, why we have built it, and how you can succeed with Medusa. Medusa is an open-source headless commerce engine that can power amazing digital commerce experiences and it is a great choice for any new headless ecommerce project out there.\n\nHeadless ecommere has gained plenty of interest recently and more and more businesses are looking towards making the shift to a headless solution to leverage a more modular setup and all the benefits it brings, such as: better page performance, greater flexibility, better support for unique customer experiences, support for best-in-breed tech stacks, etc. When we first started working on Medusa we had no idea what headless ecommerce meant, and initially, we set out to build a fully-fledged platform, but more on this later!\n\nThis is the first blog post we are publishing and it will stand as an important milestone for our work going forward. We have found that through modularity and simplicity our merchants end up being able to do much more with much less, which is why we will keep pursuing this approach when building out our product further. We want to provide a foundational set of building blocks that can be used to create unique, interesting, and powerful digital commerce experiences and we are so excited to see what amazing work we can help create.\n\n## Why we built Medusa\n\nWe didn’t wake up one morning thinking to ourselves that we wanted to build a headless commerce engine, but rather we got to build Medusa through experience with the limitations of existing platforms. Before transitioning to working full-time on Medusa, we operated as an agency, building all kinds of tools for our customers. We built everything from portfolio websites to custom integrations to ecommerce websites, but quickly started specializing in the latter; as we found new customers we also experienced that many of them were hitting limitations with the platforms available at the time.\n\nThis became evident when a client of ours expressed interest in switching platforms. We started looking for good alternatives but it quickly became clear that none of them would support the expansion across markets and brand ownership that they required so we decided with them that we should try to build a bespoke solution that would cater to their exact needs and so we began building a fully-fledged ecommerce platform with a CMS system, fulfilment system, etc. It was not soon after that we realized that we couldn’t do everything well at once so we started removing parts of what we’d built and replacing them with integrations to better tools. In the end, we were left with a core that was capable of processing and managing orders, ensuring payments were going through, and handling basic product and customer data. What was even more important was that this core was extremely good at integrating other tools and as such able to function as the glue between all the tools and services in your ecommerce stack. Essentially we had built a headless ecommerce engine, simply by following what was easiest for us as developers and most cost-efficient and scalable for our customers.\n\nOur customers were really happy with the solution as they were able to expand to multiple markets while picking and choosing from any services they found interesting without having to worry about the cost of integration. Furthermore, our customers got a high degree of ownership when using our custom-built solution, as they could ask us to build features that they needed and have them released typically within a couple of days. When contemplating how we could ensure the same level of ownership going forward it became clear that we had to open-source the solution so that no central organization would ever be in control of what was possible for the merchant. Open-sourcing Medusa would also bring a bunch of other benefits such as leveraging the community for feedback and contributions which further strengthens the product.\n\nAfter experiencing the issues with the existing platforms we were confident that our product would be a good alternative for many new ecommerce projects and shortly after we decided to open-source the product we started pulling out the generic parts of the implementations we had done, gave it the name Medusa and made it available through GitHub. [Go to Github to view the open source project](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa).\n\n## Headless: The next generation of commerce\n\nIn the early days of the internet operating ecommerce required big budgets and with customers still being new to the digital purchasing experience, only a small group of large enterprises set up online commerce channels by either building them from scratch or using solutions like Hybris. As more customers moved online, new platforms as Magento, Shopify, and WooCommerce emerged — these were easy to use and enabled merchants to make digital commerce available as a secondary sales channel.\n\nIn recent years, ecommerce has become a primary channel for many businesses leading to fierce competition in the space, increasing the need for custom solutions to give unique buying experiences. In the quest for customization, many businesses have been left frustrated with the lack of flexibility that existing platforms provide. While optimizing for ease of use, most traditional platforms is putting their focus on templated “out-of-the-box” solutions neglecting the constraints this inevitably put on the development flexibility. In many cases, businesses have been forced to converge towards compromised solutions, or even make entire platform shifts, as their needs grow beyond what a templated solution can offer. Simultaneously, a much wider variety of businesses (e.g. service providers, B2B companies etc.) requiring fully custom solutions from the beginning have started moving online.\n\nThe increasing demand for customization and flexibility has spurred an interest in headless commerce among performance-focused merchants that want differentiated and fully optimized customer experiences. Yet, many of them are still to make the move. One of the main reasons, why headless has yet to become the dominant type of ecommerce is that it can be expensive to operate a headless ecommerce stack as you need developers that can maintain the infrastructure that powers the integrations between systems in your stack and a high up-front investment for making the initial setup. This is something we are solving with Medusa by providing infrastructure that is preconfigured and optimized to run your projects.\n\n## Putting the developer first in your commerce setup\n\nThe modularity and ownership that Medusa can offer is capable of powering incredibly diverse applications ranging from ecommerce websites to more niche cases like in-restaurant experiences and will with high probability be suitable for whatever digital commerce experience you can think of. Many businesses postpone the transition to headless as it can seem daunting and complex when you need developers to maintain your infrastructure and operations; we will make it possible to take out these concerns completely by providing the infrastructure that is configured and optimized to run Medusa projects, thereby making it much cheaper and more accessible for businesses to make the transition to headless early on.\n\nIn more general terms we will be focusing on enabling the developer to do much more with less; this is in line with making sure that merchants can take ownership of their commerce setup as developers can help steer the direction and roadmap for your project without relying on us to create the features you need. By creating powerful tools for the developer we enable them to be more efficient and focused in their work. Examples of tools that we are building are; an infrastructure platform so developers don’t have to configure servers and databases, a powerful CLI that automates the redundant tasks developers face, a React component library to make it easy to build storefronts for Medusa, rich documentation that makes it easy to find what you are looking for and much more.\n\nWith the core project being open-source we will also be open for contributions from the community making sure that we always have a product that is loved by developers so that they can do more!\n\n## What’s next?\n\nWe are working hard on completing our infrastructure product so that projects can easily be deployed to the cloud. In the meantime, if you are a developer we encourage you to try out Medusa, you can get up and running within 5 minutes and get a quick overview of what features our platform will bring.

Recently, two of our [Medusa Experts](https://medusajs.com/experts/), [Rigby](https://rigby.pl/) and [Agilo](https://agilo.co/), also open-sourced some of the larger plugins they have developed. Check it all out below.\n\n## Medusa Admin translated into +20 languages\n\nThe amount of community language contributions has been exceptional since we [announced multi-language support in September](https://medusajs.com/blog/announcing-multi-language-support/). Medusa now supports over 20 languages, including English, French, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Japanese, Chinese, and many more. [Check out all the translations](https://docs.medusajs.com/user-guide/tips/languages) or learn how you can [contribute to the translation efforts](https://docs.medusajs.com/contribution/admin-translations).\n\n## Medusa Custom Attributes Plugin\n\n[Viktor Holik](https://github.com/vholik) from the Medusa Expert partner, [Rigby](https://rigby.pl/), recently contributed a new [Custom Attributes Plugin](https://github.com/vholik/medusa-custom-attributes) that allows you to expand the current product attributes to include new ones specific to your use case, such as “furniture type” or “Year of production”. These custom attributes can be in the form of strings, numbers, booleans, or arrays.\n\nThe plugin has a UI allowing you to access all your custom attributes from a separate Custom Attributes page in your Medusa Admin. After creating a custom attribute, you can edit it for each product on the Product page using a [widget](https://docs.medusajs.com/admin/widgets). The plugin is actively used in the vintage marketplace, [Patyna](https://medusajs.com/blog/patyna-vintage-marketplace/).\n\nRead more about the plugin in Viktor's blog posts around it, [part 1](https://medium.com/rigby-software-house/adding-custom-attributes-in-medusa-js-ba1af9f312bb) and [part 2](https://medium.com/rigby-software-house/introducing-custom-attributes-in-medusa-js-part-2-ui-8c1f111f8845).\n\n![](/images/cropped.png)\n\n## Medusa WordPress Plugin\n\n[Ante Primorac](https://github.com/anteprimorac) and [Anamarija Papić](https://github.com/anamarijapapic) from another Medusa Expert partner, [Agilo](https://agilo.co/), have built a new plugin named [MedusaWP](https://github.com/Agilo/medusawp). This plugin allows you to use [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) as a CMS with Medusa. It enables you to import various data from Medusa into WordPress, including products, collections, thumbnails, and more.\n\nThe plugin also offers an overview of your data health, identifying any sync errors, partially synced items, and successful synchs. It also includes a country switcher feature for stores with multiple regions, which updates cart regions based on the country code.\n\nAt last, the plugin provides a feature-rich set of functions for your WordPress theme. These include [medusa-react](https://docs.medusajs.com/medusa-react/overview) utility functions for calculating and formatting prices and amounts.\n\nYou can view the full plugin and its feature set within the [MedusaWP repo](https://github.com/Agilo/medusawp).\n\n![](/images/292096021-a4a7b8f5-5a2a-44ff-a5bf-bdbaa64a2111%20\\(1\\)%201.png)\n\n## Multi-platform starter templates for Medusa\n\n[Rodrigo Figueroa](https://github.com/bidah) developed a starter kit, [Universal Medusa](https://github.com/bidah/universal-medusa), that lets you create multi-platform storefronts using [Next.js](http://nextjs.org/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev/) with a Medusa backend.\n\nUniversal Medusa offers a comprehensive development setup that includes shared Tailwind CSS styles and components adapted for native mobile development using [Nativewind](https://nativewind.dev/). The starter mostly matches Medusa's previous feature set and design from the [Next.js Starter Template](https://medusajs.com/nextjs-commerce/).\n\nCheck out the [project’s website](https://universal-medusa-docs.vercel.app) to get started. Or check out Rodrigo’s latest [Mobile Medusa](https://github.com/bidah/mobile-medusa) starter for a React Native mobile starter.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; height: 700px; width: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/community-multi-platform-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/community-multi-platform.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\n## Medusa Admin mobile (beta)\n\n[Ragheb](https://github.com/mllrr96) is developing [Medusa Admin Mobile](https://github.com/mllrr96/Medusa-Admin-Flutter), a mobile-friendly Medusa Admin app for iOS and Android. This app is built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and comes in a [pre-compiled APK file](https://github.com/mllrr96/Medusa-Admin-Flutter/releases) for Android users. Although the app is in beta, it allows you to view and modify various aspects of your store, including settings, orders, products, customer information, discounts, gift cards, price lists, and more.\n\nThe latest version features a new look with material design and several themes. To try the application, visit the [Git repository](https://github.com/mllrr96/Medusa-Admin-Flutter), which provides all the steps to get started. Ragheb also encourages feedback either in the [project thread on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/876835651130097704/1149712066119217453) or in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mllrr96/Medusa-Admin-Flutter).\n\n![](/images/Untitled%20\\(12\\).png)\n\n## Ultimate Medusa Plugin (beta)\n\n[Kichou Nadir](https://github.com/raideno) is developing the [Ultimate Plugin](https://github.com/raideno/medusa-plugin-ultimate). This plugin provides a user interface for interacting with new entities added to your Medusa store. It allows you to create, edit, view, and delete documents associated with those entities directly within the Medusa Admin. For example, if you add a blog entity (database table, service, route, loader, etc.), the plugin will allow you to manage related documents for each blog post directly from the admin dashboard.\n\nRead more about the plugin in Kichou's [documentation](https://medusa-plugin-ultimate.raideno.xyz/). Please note that the plugin is still in beta mode.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/community-ultimate-medusa-plugin-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/community-ultimate-medusa-plugin.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\n## Let us know what you are building\n\nWe would love to hear about the cool projects you have created with Medusa.

The company started in 2013 and has since grown to serve a diverse market of private and B2B customers, such as architects, retailers, and designers. Today, more than 2,000 vendors use the platform to market their vintage furniture, from established wholesalers to local sellers.\n\nSupported by their implementation partner, [Rigby](https://rigby.pl/), Patyna migrated from WooCommerce to Medusa. With Medusa, Patyna has been able to experiment and build new features faster while spending less time on maintenance and debugging. Along with the migration, Patyna built an admin setup with multiple user types and accesses, custom category control, a mechanism for order splitting, and much more.\n\n\u003ccallout icon=\"lightBulbSolid\" button-label=\"Get started\" \nbutton-url=\"https://docs.medusajs.com/recipes/marketplace\"\u003e\n**Marketplace Recipe**\nSet up your own marketplace with Medusa. \u003c/callout\u003e\n\n## 34% traffic uplift and 30% shorter time to market\n\nPatyna's team originally built their marketplace using WooCommerce. However, they constantly faced two major challenges: site performance and the release speed of new features. The performance issues stemmed from the platform being bloated with plugins and hacky workarounds, adversely impacting page load time and causing crashes during traffic peaks. Furthermore, vendors experienced considerable load time when making updates to their stores.\n\nThe slow development velocity resulted from the team spending too much time on platform maintenance and debugging. The tightly intertwined logic in WooCommerce meant that overriding parts of the system and its plugins could cause problems elsewhere, making root causes hard to identify and debugging a laborious task.\n\nMedusa addressed both of these challenges. Its composable nature allowed Rigby to easily use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to build a custom and performant frontend, resulting in a 34% traffic increase two months after going live. By optimizing CI/CD pipelines, minimizing debugging and maintenance time, and enabling smoother implementation of custom functionality, Medusa reduced the time to market for new features by 30%. Especially the ability to rapidly build custom logic was something Rigby found unique about the Medusa framework.\n\n\u003cquote name=\"Jakub Zbąski\" title=\"Co-founder and CEO at Rigby\"\u003e\nWe looked into other solutions, but I do not think it would have been possible, even at the slightest part, with any of the existing open-source or SaaS solutions to get the same result.\n\u003c/quote\u003e\n\n## Custom marketplace functionalities and multiple accesses\n\nIn setting up their marketplace, Rigby aimed for simplicity in their stack using only a few external services. They used [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) to manage content data such as homepage images, text, and About pages. [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com) and [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) were used for marketing, [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) for application monitoring, and [OpenReplay](https://openreplay.com/) for user session recordings.![patyna-tech-stack](/images/tech%20stack.png)\n\nThe marketplace encompasses three user types: customers, vendors, and Patyna Admin. For vendors and Patyna Admin, Rigby created separate admin dashboards with unique access levels and control features.\n\n### Patyna Admin: Controlling the marketplace\n\nPatyna’s admin has a custom dashboard from where they can control the entire marketplace. They can view all products, orders, vendors, and customers across the platform. Additionally, it allowed the team to:\n\n*   **Create sales reports:** This allows Patyna to generate PDF reports with sales and margin overviews across all products and vendors.\n\n*   **Manage product attributes:** This enables Patyna to define both standard product attributes (e.g., date of production) and custom attributes per product category (e.g., \"Types of legs\" for sofas). These attributes are then filterable for customers on the marketplace and must be filled out by vendors when creating new products within a category.\n\n*   **Control discounts and gift cards:** This allows them to create special customer discount codes or gift cards that can be used across all vendors.\n\n### Vendors: Controlling their store operations\n\nVendors are limited to controlling and accessing orders, customers, and products related to their own stores. Additionally, Rigby built custom functionality for:\n\n*   **Self-pickup delivery:** This feature allows vendors to offer pickup options for their products, and they can then manually mark orders as collected in their admin dashboard upon customer pick-up.\n\n*   **Custom order splitting:** When customers purchase products from multiple vendors, the order is split under the hood, ensuring each vendor manages only their part while the customer sees it all as a single order.\n\n*   **'Classics' products:** Patyna has a unique section in their marketplace called 'Classics' for select iconic products. Vendors can propose products for this section directly in their admin dashboard, and the Patyna Admin then gets a chance to review the submissions afterward and approve them within their dashboard.\n\nBeing able to ship custom features faster has paid off. Patyna quickly saw a resurgence in vendor activity on the platform, and some vendors even expressed their satisfaction with the platform's improved usability, noting that they were now inclined to add more products to the new platform because of its improved usability and performance.\n\n![patyna-admin-overview](/images/admin-overview.png)\n\n## Cutting maintenance and debugging time in half\n\nFor Rigby, the case demonstrated the profound impact the Medusa framework could have on their development velocity. Patyna's team estimated that Medusa roughly halved the time spent on ongoing maintenance and debugging. The framework made it easier for the team to keep logs for debugging purposes while offering an overall better developer experience when implementing custom logic and functionality.\n\nDespite using various composable ecommerce frameworks in the past, Rigby's learnings from Patyna convinced them to commit to Medusa for the future. Today, Rigby is included in [Medusa's Expert list](https://medusajs.com/experts/) and has chosen Medusa as their framework for multiple other ecommerce cases. For them, the decisive factors for doubling down on Medusa were the developer experience and scalability.\n\n\u003cquote name=\"Jakub Zbąski\" title=\"Co-founder and CEO at Rigby\"\u003e\nThe whole developer experience was really awesome. From managing vast product listings to handling intricate vendor details, Medusa provided a robust and scalable solution.\n\u003c/quote\u003e\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/custom-documentation-tools.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/custom-documentation-tools.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/custom-documentation-tools.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Our Custom Tools for Great Documentation","theme":"light","headerOverlaysContent":false,"featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/custom-tools-65e3a100.png","altText":"Post thumbnail image","caption":""},"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","date":"2023-12-21","authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-eb2no2kx3.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-eb2no2kx3.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-eb2no2kx3.json"},"firstName":"Shahed ","lastName":"Nasser","role":"Role","image":{"url":"/images/27354907.jpeg","altText":"Person photo"},"type":"Person"}],"excerpt":"We created custom documentation tooling that helps us adopt a more docs-as-code approach","category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json"},"name":"Product","type":"Category"},"markdown_content":"In 2023, we introduced many new features, architectural changes, and developer experience enhancements in Medusa. The latest of which is highlighted in our [Recap 3](https://medusajs.com/recap/) page.\n\nWe recognized the importance of making sure the documentation aligns with the core product at the same speed. We knew we had to enforce a docs-as-code approach further to do so. A docs-as-code approach encourages adopting processes, testing practices, and implementations with documentation typically used with code.\n\nAs a result, we've created a custom documentation toolkit that we use internally, ranging from low-level documentation generation tools to custom-built documentation websites.\n\nIn this article, I'll share with you some of the custom documentation tools we built in 2023 at Medusa and some of the plans we have to continue improving our documentation.\n\n## Why Build Custom Tools\n\nPreviously, our documentation was built using tools like Docusaurus and Redocly. Our team manually wrote the content within the documentation as Markdown files within the Docusaurus codebase.\n\nWhile this setup worked initially, it was only a short time until Medusa outgrew it. The quick pace of releases made information in the documentation stale; the large number of API routes slowed down the API Reference; introducing new features like [Modules](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/overview) and [Workflows](https://medusajs.com/blog/announcing-medusa-workflows-sdk/) raised the need for understandable and easy-to-use references.\n\nOur documentation tools weren't enough anymore. So, we started building a documentation toolkit to resolve our problems and improve the developer experience in our documentation.\n\n## Custom REST API Reference\n\nPreviously, our REST API Reference website was built using Redocly as part of our main documentation website, built with Docusaurus. While Redocly is a great tool for building an API reference website, we had performance issues due to our wide-reaching commerce API Routes and information within each of those routes.\n\nWe explored different existing options, but none satisfied our use case. As a result, we decided to build a [custom API Reference website](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/store) from scratch.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/api-reference-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/api-reference.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\nThe website is built with Next.js 14, and documentation for Medusa’s API Routes is loaded on demand, improving the website's overall performance. Our designer also created a fresh and clean design for the new API reference.\n\nYou can check out the source code [here](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/tree/develop/www/apps/api-reference).\n\n## References Generator\n\nAfter introducing the [Product](https://docs.medusajs.com/experimental/product/overview) and [Pricing](https://docs.medusajs.com/experimental/pricing/overview) Modules, we wanted to provide a clear API reference in our documentation for the main interface of each module. We also wanted to improve our existing references, such as the JS Client reference.\n\nTo do that, we used [Typedoc](https://typedoc.org/), a tool that generates documentation from comments in TypeScript source code, with existing and custom plugins relevant to our use case. Some of the plugins we built were:\n\n*   A plugin that converts OpenApi Specification (OAS) schemas to their equivalent TSDoc comments. This is especially useful for our JS Client reference as we can reuse the same request and response type details used for the REST API Reference.\n\n*   A plugin that uses ESLint to lint code examples in the TSDoc comments.\n\n*   A plugin that allows injecting custom frontmatter into Markdown files.\n\n![](/images/references-generation.jpg)\n\nThis also allowed us to bring the documentation close to the code, which:\n\n*   Mitigates information staleness: as members of our engineering team make changes to the code, they can directly reflect the changes on the documentation in the code's doc-block.\n\n*   Improves code readability and maintainability.\n\n*   Provides better auto-complete descriptions during development.\n\nThis encouraged us to move more of our documentation pages to live closer to the code, which is still ongoing.\n\n## Coming Soon: Workflows Diagram Generator\n\nIn [Recap 3](https://medusajs.com/recap/), we introduced Workflows. A workflow is a series of steps that complete a task and can be executed from anywhere. Aside from providing the necessary documentation for Workflows, we also wanted to visualize workflows in the documentation for a better developer experience.\n\nSo, we built a tool that creates [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams of workflows used in the Medusa backend, which can be visualized in the documentation.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/workflows-diagram-generator-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/workflows-diagram-generator.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\nWhile we still need to incorporate it in our documentation, we've built the necessary foundation of this tool to make it possible and look forward to adding it to our documentation soon.\n\nYou can check out the source code [here](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/tree/develop/docs-util/packages/workflows-diagrams-generator).\n\n## UI Props Generator\n\nIn 2023, we introduce [Medusa UI](https://docs.medusajs.com/ui), a package of UI components that implement the Medusa design system and allow developers to build customizations in the admin with a consistent design.\n\nIn the [Medusa UI documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/ui), we show the props that each component accepts. To ensure that these props remain up-to-date, we created a tool that generates JSON spec files for each component from the source code.\n\nThese spec files are then loaded in the Medusa UI documentation website, built on Next.js 14, to display the component's details and props.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot%202023-12-13%20at%207.50.18%E2%80%AFPM.png)\n\nThis tool is built on top of [react-docgen](https://react-docgen.dev/), which extracts details of React components and generates JSON documentation, and Typedoc. As we faced some limitations with `react-docgen`, we customized its handlers and resolvers to ensure that all props and components were recognized and used Typedoc to fill in any missing details.\n\nYou can find the source code of the tool [here](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/tree/develop/docs-util/packages/react-docs-generator).\n\n## Generate Documentation on Release\n\nBuilding the tools is one thing, but another important aspect is ensuring the documentation is updated whenever there's a new Medusa release.\n\nSo, we've added GitHub actions that run whenever a new release is published, making documentation updates part of the release pipeline.\n\n![](/images/release-process.jpg)\n\nThis GitHub action checks for any updates in the REST APIs, UI props, and general references and opens a pull request with the updates, eliminating the need to make the updates manually.\n\n## Notable Documentation Improvements\n\nAside from the custom documentation toolkit, we've continued improving our documentation to provide a better developer experience. The improvements include:\n\nAdded a Recipes section in our documentation, with guided learning paths that you can start and finish at your own pace.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/learning-path-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/learning-path.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\nAn enhanced search experience with intuitive navigation.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/search-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/search.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\nAn AI Assistant to provide help during your learning journey.\n\n\u003cvideo controls preload=\"none\" style=\"object-fit: cover; max-height: unset; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" poster=\"/images/ai-assistant-cover.png\"\u003e\n\u003csource src=\"/videos/ai-assistant.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /\u003e\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\n## Future of Docs at Medusa\n\nThere are still many more improvements to be made both for our documentation and its underlying tooling and processes. Also, since Medusa’s features now make it suitable for orchestration tooling, developers need to understand Medusa as a framework, which requires building a learning path that teaches Medusa’s concepts from end to end.\n\nWhile it's difficult to list all of the documentation plans, some of the ideas we have for the near future include:\n\n*   Improved documentation structure with better learning paths and guidance.\n\n*   Interactive API reference and UI documentation.\n\n*   Better feedback collection from users to keep improving our documentation and core product.\n\nIf you have any ideas for improvements and new features or find bugs in our documentation, please share them with us on [GitHub](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa), [Discord](https://discord.gg/F87eGuwkTp), or our social channels.\n\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/announcing-improved-subscriber-api.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/announcing-improved-subscriber-api.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/announcing-improved-subscriber-api.md"},"type":"PostLayout","title":"Announcing Improved Subscriber API","theme":"light","headerOverlaysContent":false,"seo_description":"This is a new page","seo_keywords":"javascript, open source","date":"2023-11-27","authors":[{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-5u6je47u2.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-5u6je47u2.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-5u6je47u2.json"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Kasper","image":{"url":"/images/Kasper.webp","altText":"Person photo"},"lastName":"Kristensen","role":"SW Engineer"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/person-wjmuzl9rr.json"},"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Juhl","role":"CTO \u0026 Co-founder","image":{"url":"/images/oli.jpeg","altText":"Oliver Juhl"},"type":"Person","bio":"CTO \u0026 Co-founder of Medusa\n"}],"excerpt":"Our improved Subscriber API allows developers to run logic in response to events in Medusa using simple JavaScript functions.","category":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"/vercel/path0/content/data","relSourcePath":"category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/category/category-sv7j5xvtu.json"},"name":"Product","type":"Category"},"featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/subscriber.png","altText":"altText of the image","caption":"Caption of the image","objectPosition":"50% 50%","objectFit":"cover","elementId":"","height":0,"width":0},"markdown_content":"We care deeply about developer experience across all our products. Our primitives and tooling allow developers to effortlessly build digital commerce applications at record speed.\n\nToday, we are excited to announce a massive update to our Subscriber API that significantly improves the developer experience of a core concept in Medusa’s customization toolbox.\n\n## Subscribers\n\nServices in Medusa emit events whenever actions like creating and updating records occur. Subscribers in Medusa provide a way for developers to run asynchronous logic in response to these events. This could include syncing a product to an external service when it is updated in Medusa or applying a special discount when a set of specific products is added to a cart.\n\nWith our updated API, you can create subscribers using a pattern similar to how you build API Routes.\n\n\u003ccodeblock language=\"ts\"\u003e\n```\n// src/subscribers/order-placed.ts\nexport default async function ({ data, container }) {\n    const { id } = data\n\n    const slackService = container.resolve(\"slackService\")\n    const orderService = container.resolve(\"orderService\")\n\n    const order = await orderService.retrieve(id)\n\n    await slackService.sendNotis({ data: order })\n}\n\nexport const config: SubscriberConfig = {\n    event: OrderService.Events.PLACED,\n}\n```\n\u003c/codeblock\u003e\n\nExample of a Subscriber\n\nThe example above illustrates a few key points of the updated Subscriber API:\n\n*   Exports from files in `/subscribers` control the behavior of your event handlers. The default export is a function with the logic to run, and the `config` export specifies the event that logic should be run in response to\n\n*   The handler accepts an argument of type `SubscriberArgs`. This can be de-structured to access the event data and the Medusa container.\n\nIn the example above, we register a handler that is run every time the product updated event is triggered.\n\nThe new approach to registering subscribers also comes with the benefit of making it easier than ever to set up a handler for multiple events. The `event` field in the config accepts either a single event or a list of events. Continuing with the above example, it would be possible to update the handler to update the external system when a product is created, updated, and deleted.\n\n```ts\n// src/subscribers/product-sync.ts\nimport { syncProductsWorkflow } from \"../workflows\"\n\nexport default async function ({ data, eventName, container }) {\n  await syncProductsWorkflow.run({ input: data })\n}\n\nexport const config: SubscriberConfig = {\n  event: [\n\t\tProductService.Events.CREATED,\n\t\tProductService.Events.UPDATED,\n\t\tProductService.Events.DELETED\n\t]\n}\n```\n\nBy updating the `event` field and adding a few additional lines of code, the handler can now process all relevant events. This keeps the external system synchronized with Medusa.\n\n## What is next?\n\nWe are excited to hear your thoughts about our new Subscriber API.

A key challenge is to ensure these systems work together to complete the tasks that drive your business forward. We are, therefore, incredibly excited to announce the beta release of Medusa Workflows, a new, powerful primitive in the Medusa toolbox to help build custom business flows involving multiple systems.\n\nMedusa’s Workflows SDK enables developers to write critical business flows with a simple DX and a strong foundation. Workflows have built-in retry and rollback mechanisms, which make them resilient to intermittent failures and a great place to define your commerce stack’s integrations and customizations.\n\nMedusa Workflows are not dependent on Medusa’s commerce modules. You can start using them to integrate your commerce stack regardless of what ecommerce platform you are on, giving you access to Medusa’s powerful customization tools without needing to migrate your commerce platform.\n\n## Build a Workflow\n\nBuilding Workflows is like writing JavaScript functions, but unlike regular functions, the Workflows SDK creates an internal representation of your Workflow to keep track of its progress, retry failing steps, and roll back operations if necessary.\n\n### Define a Workflow Step\n\nTo create a Workflow, you first define a Workflow Step using the Workflows SDK’s `createStep` function.\n\n```ts\nimport { createStep, StepResponse } from \"@medusajs/workflows-sdk\"\n\nconst reserveInventory = createStep(\"reserve-inventory\", async (cart, context) =\u003e {\n    const inventoryService = context.container.resolve(\"inventoryService\");\n    await inventoryService.reserveInventory(cart.items);\n    return new StepResponse({ success: true });\n  }\n);\n```\n\nThe above step resolves an Inventory Service from the dependency injection container and reserves inventory for items in a Cart. Note that the step takes a Cart as input and responds with a StepResponse. The StepResponse can be used in subsequent steps.\n\n### Create a Workflow\n\nOnce your step is created, you can use it within a Workflow. To construct a Workflow you use the `createWorkflow` helper from the Workflows SDK.\n\n```ts\nimport { createStep, StepResponse, createWorkflow } from \"@medusajs/workflows-sdk\"\n\nconst reserveInventory = createStep(\"reserve-inventory\", async (cart, context) =\u003e {\n  const inventoryService = context.container.resolve(\"inventoryService\");\n  await inventoryService.reserveInventory(cart.items);\n  return new StepResponse({ success: true });\n});\n\nconst acceptQuoteWorkflow = createWorkflow(\"accept-quote\", function (input) {\n  const cart = retrieveCart(input.cartQuoteId);\n  reserveInventory(cart);\n  authorizePayment(cart);\n  createOrder(cart);\n});\n```\n\nThe above Workflow accepts a quote shared with a customer, and the step we created to reserve inventory is used as part of the Workflow. In the Workflow, we have used our `reserveInventory` Workflow Step.\n\nThe function passed to `createWorkflow` is used to generate a representation of the Workflow logic and map the data dependencies between steps. For example, the Workflow SDK knows that `reserveInventory` step needs the output of `retrieveCart` as its input. This enables Medusa to automatically retry a step if it fails and only progress when possible and allowed. If a step fails more than a configurable number of times, Medusa will automatically roll back previous steps.\n\n### Defining compensating actions\n\nLet’s define the compensation for our `reserveInventory` step. We do this by specifying what data our step will need to roll back in the StepResponse and a compensation function to execute when rolling back.\n\n```ts\nimport { createStep, StepResponse } from \"@medusajs/workflows-sdk\"\n\nconst reserveInventory = createStep(\"reserve-inventory\", async (cart, context) =\u003e {\n    const inventoryService = context.container.resolve(\"inventoryService\");\n    await inventoryService.reserveInventory(cart.items);\n    return new StepResponse({ success: true }, cart.items);\n  },\n  async (items, context) =\u003e {\n    const inventoryService = context.container.resolve(\"inventoryService\");\n    await inventoryService.releaseInventory(items);\n  }\n);\n```\n\nNote that the StepResponse now specifies the `cart.items` as rollback data. This is then used in the compensation function to release the inventory.\n\n### Triggering a Workflow\n\nYou can execute a Workflow from different places within Medusa. For example, you may use API Routes if you want the workflow to execute in response to an API request or a webhook. Subscribers if you want to execute a workflow when an event is triggered. Or Scheduled Jobs if you want your workflow to execute regularly.\n\nHere’s an example of executing a Workflow in an API Route. You can learn about more ways of triggering Workflows in our docs.\n\n```ts\n// src/api/quotes/accept/route.ts\n\nimport { acceptQuoteWorkflow } from \"@/workflows\"\n\nexport async function POST(req, res) {\n  const workflow = acceptQuoteWorkflow(req.scope)\n\n  await workflow.run({\n    cartQuoteId: req.cart_id\n  })\n\n  res.json({ accepted: true })\n}\n```\n\n## What can you use Workflows for?\n\nMedusa Workflows are especially good for orchestrating multiple tools to achieve a task. Integrating systems in your stack using Workflows, for example, ensures that data is kept consistent and that unexpected errors are handled gracefully. To build an integration with Workflows, you would create a custom Medusa service connecting to your 3rd party system. The custom service can then be resolved in your steps to execute actions.\n\nThe more systems you integrate with Medusa, the more Workflows you can create to automate your operations and push your customer experience forward. Consider the example of integrating purchase orders from your ERP system with inbounds in your WMS system. With a Medusa connection to your ERP and WMS, you can easily map the purchase order flow and other ERP to WMS flows. Additionally, because you have other connections - like your product information - available, you can leverage those in your Workflows. For example, you can quickly configure your purchase order Workflow to record the expected restock date of your products to display to customers.\n\n![](/images/Untitled%20\\(8\\)-65817d5b.png)\n\n### Long-running workflows (coming soon)\n\nWith the initial beta release, Workflows can run exclusively in-band. We will soon add support for long-running Workflows that include asynchronous operations or human-in-the-loop steps. This opens further use cases for Workflows. For example, you can build a Workflow to manage the preparation of new products for sale. The Workflow starts when a product is inbounded at your warehouse. Then, tasks can kick off for taking pack shots, writing titles and descriptions, translating copy, and merchandizing the product. As each task is completed, the Workflow can proceed. All tasks would be mapped as Workflow Steps and could be completed in systems across your stack. If a task fails to complete or a configurable timeout is reached, rollback logic can help keep your data consistent, or notify responsible parties.\n\n![](/images/long-running%20\\(1\\).png)\n\n## Core Workflows\n\nWorkflows are a key part of our efforts toward shipping Medusa 2.0. With Medusa 2.0, we are decoupling most of Medusa’s internal services and bringing them to standalone packages available on npm. This means you can use Medusa’s services, like Products, Pricing, Carts, etc., independently from the rest of Medusa. We will continue to offer Medusa’s powerful and customizable commerce API in a way that’s easy to install with `npx create-medusa-app`. For each default API endpoint, there will be an available core Workflow to do things like creating products, adding to cart, applying discounts, and much, much more. The core Workflows will orchestrate Medusa (or custom) modules and be extensible. This does two things:\n\n1.  It makes Medusa pluggable - you can use any provider to handle Products, Carts, Discounts, etc. The Workflow will call the provider when it needs to.\n\n2.  You will get a new and easy way to extend business logic by injecting custom code into Workflows. There is no need to modify core services or override default endpoints; the Workflow will ensure your custom logic is called when required.\n\nCore Workflows are introduced incrementally behind the `medusa_v2` feature flag, and more and more Workflows become available as we ship new Commerce Modules.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nThe Workflows SDK joins Custom Entities, Services, API Routes, Subscribers, and Cron Jobs in the Medusa toolbox. With Workflows, Medusa provides a primitive for building custom business flows spanning multiple systems. It has built-in failure handling and rollback logic to ensure your critical Workflows run smoothly and your data is kept consistent. You can start using the Workflows SDK without migrating to Medusa’s commerce modules, making it an excellent tool for integrating your digital commerce stack and building customizations for customer experiences and internal operations.\n\nVisit [our docs](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/workflows) to get started with Workflows.

The Pricing Module ships as an npm package that can be installed in any Node project requiring advanced pricing logic and is integrated into Medusa experimentally behind the `medusa_v2` feature flag as part of our efforts to [release Medusa 2.0](https://medusajs.com/blog/toward-medusa-2/).\n\nIn Medusa, the Pricing Module is used to set prices for Product Variants conditional on currencies, regions, customer groups, sales channels, and more. You can read more about the Pricing Module functionality [here](https://medusajs.com/pricing-module/). Now, the Pricing Module’s logic works entirely independently and can be used to configure prices for anything specific to your needs.\n\nThe Pricing Module has two key functionalities:\n\n1.  Creating a set of prices for a resource with pricing rules governing when each is applicable.\n\n2.  Choosing the correct price to use given a context.\n\n## Using the Pricing Module\n\nImagine you want to differentiate the prices of tickets to a tech conference based on the customer’s location. You want to offer cheaper tickets to local companies. With the Pricing Module you first configure your pricing rules:\n\n```ts\nconst myTicketPriceSet = await pricingModuleService.create({\n  rules: [{ rule_attribute: \"city\" }],\n  prices: [\n    { amount: 1000, currency_code: \"usd\", rules: {} },\n    { amount: 500, currency_code: \"usd\", rules: { city: \"New York\" } },\n  ]\n})\n```\n\nThe above code returns a PriceSet to associate with your ticket.\n\nThe Pricing Module provides a `calculatePrices` function to get the correct price to charge a customer. Before calling the function you will collect the city your customer is in; for example, based on the IP address, and pass it as context `calculatePrices`.\n\n```ts\nconst [priceToCharge] = await pricingModuleSerivce.calculatePrice(\n\t{ id: [priceSet.id] },\n\t{ context: { currency_code: \"usd\", city: \"New York\" } }\n)\n\npriceToCharge // { calculated_price: 500, currency_code: \"usd\" }\n```\n\nYou can configure as many rules as you need, and the Pricing Module will always provide the correct price to your customer, considering things like overlapping applicability and rule priorities.\n\n## Serverless support\n\nThe Pricing Module is ready for serverless environments, making it possible to run price calculations from tools like Lambda, Vercel, or Netlify Functions. To use the Pricing Module in a serverless function, initialize the Pricing Module with the initialize function.\n\n```ts\n// my-next-app/app/api/price/route.ts\n\nimport { initialize } from \"@medusajs/pricing\"\nimport { headers } from 'next/headers'\n\nexport async function GET(req, res) {\n  const headers = headers()\n  const ipCity = headers.get(\"x-vercel-ip-city\")\n\n  const pricingModule = await initialize({ /* db credentials here */ })\n  const [price] = await pricingModule.calculatePrices(\n\t\t{ id: [priceId] }, \n\t\t{ context: { currency_code: \"usd\", city: ipCity } }\n\t)\n\n\tres.json({ price: price.calculated_amount })\n}\n```\n\nWith serverless support you can offer your customers fast and highly personalized experiences.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nAt Medusa, we build tools for developers to create custom digital commerce applications. The Pricing Module is another step toward preparing Medusa for version 2.0.

For example, you can push daily updates to an external ERP system or generate weekly sales reports.\n\nWith the new Scheduled Jobs API, setting up recurring tasks can be achieved with only a few lines of code with a syntax that is familiar to any JavaScript developer.\n\n```\n// src/jobs/daily-erp-update.ts\nimport { ProductService, ScheduledJobsConfig, ScheduledJobsArgs } from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\nimport ErpService from \"../services/erp\"\n\nexport default async function ({ container }: ScheduledJobsArgs) {\n\tconst productService: ProductService = container.resolve(\"productService\")\n\t// Service for interacting with external ERP system\n\tconst erpService: ErpService = container.resolve(\"erpService\")\n\t\n\tconst products = await productService.listAndCount()\n\n\tawait erpService.update(products)\n}\n\nexport const config: ScheduledJobsConfig = {\n  name: \"daily-erp-update\",\n\tschedule: \"0 0 * * *\" // At 00:00 every night\n}\n```\n\nThe above example illustrates a few key points of how to use the new Scheduled Jobs API:\n\n*   Exports from files in `/jobs` control the behavior of the action performed in your task. The default export is a function with the logic to run, and the config specifies the name and schedule of the task.\n\n*   The handler is a function that gets invoked each time the job runs. In the given example, it lists products in Medusa and forwards them to the ERP system.\n\n*   The config assigns a name to the job and sets the schedule for the job. In the provided example, the schedule is set to repeat the job every night at 00:00.\n\nYou can read more about the new API [in our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/scheduled-jobs/overview).\n\nWe are excited to hear your thoughts about our new Scheduled Jobs API.

We thought it deserved some love, so the Starter just got a big update with a complete design overhaul, Medusa UI components, Next.js 14, and better product search.\n\nThe goal of the Starter is to provide a foundation for developers to build on. It consists of a fully functional ecommerce frontend, already connected to a Medusa backend. We aimed for a design that is fresh but neutral so you can easily customize it to fit your brand.\n\n## Medusa UI Support\n\nWe redesigned the Starter to work with [Medusa UI](https://docs.medusajs.com/ui) components and icons. This results in a fresh, recognizable design language and components that allow for easy customization.\n\nMedusa UI is a React implementation of the Medusa design system. The collection includes components, hooks, utility functions, icons, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes. It's designed for building a consistent user interface across Medusa Admin and other Medusa applications.\n\n## Ready for Medusa 2.0\n\nWhile we [work toward Medusa 2.0](https://medusajs.com/blog/toward-medusa-2/), you can already try out some of our cutting-edge serverless modules with the Next.js Starter. The Starter has support for both the [Product](https://docs.medusajs.com/modules/products/serverless-module) and the Pricing module, as well as Remote Query to build your own serverless product endpoints. If you’re feeling adventurous, you can enable these experimental features by enabling the `MEDUSA_FF_MEDUSA_V2` feature flag in both the Starter and the server.\n\n## New design showcase\n\n### Home\n\nThe homepage has been cleaned up and now shows featured product collections.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot%202023-11-23%20at%2009.43.56-12d8a5f8.jpg)\n\n### Product detail page\n\nThe product detail page has a new layout and now uses Medusa UI components.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot%202023-11-23%20at%2009.43.45.jpg)\n\n### Product overview page\n\nThe product overview page has been redesigned and now features sorting out of the box.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot%202023-11-23%20at%2009.45.30.jpg)\n\n### Product search\n\nThe Starter already supported Algolia and MeiliSearch out of the box, but now has a revamped instant search UI and a server-rendered search results page.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot%202023-11-23%20at%2009.46.41.jpg)\n\n### Cart\n\nThe new cart design is built almost exclusively from Medusa UI components.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot%202023-11-23%20at%2009.47.51.jpg)\n\n### Checkout\n\nThe redesigned checkout process provides a streamlined experience, making it easier than ever for customers to finalize their purchases.\n\n![](/images/Screenshot%202023-11-23%20at%2009.50.39.jpg)\n\n### Get started with Next.js and Medusa\n\nSee the full new design in action in our [updated hosted demo](https://next.medusajs.com/).\n\nWant to build with the Starter yourself?

Often, these are e-commerce sites, but they can also be [marketplaces](https://medusajs.com/blog/foraged-custom-marketplace/), [enterprise OMS systems](https://medusajs.com/blog/makro-omnichannel-order-orchestration/), [B2B commerce platforms](https://medusajs.com/blog/visionary-b2b/), and much more. When we started Medusa, we wanted to build something to avoid the frustrating and painful hacky workarounds we had encountered with other commerce platforms. And now, thousands of companies are using Medusa, including fast-moving startups and some of the world’s largest companies. It’s hard to explain how happy and proud we are to share our work with you, and our top priority continues to be improving your experience.\n\n## Taming complexity in your stack\n\nCompanies reach for Medusa to manage complex workflows that SaaS providers and other open-source tools can’t handle. Examples of complexity we have seen include gathering customer data across different channels to deliver personalized experiences. Or fulfilling thousands of daily orders from hundreds of distribution centers in the way that best aligns with business strategies. Or creating a seamless B2B purchasing experience for highly configurable products. The complexity companies experience is especially common when multiple systems have to work together to deliver a customer experience or automate a business flow.\n\nMany companies try to tame their complexity by building applications from scratch that tie systems together and define customizations; however, building the foundation for such applications takes focus from serving customers best. Medusa has proven to be a much better starting point for businesses to accomplish their customizations than anywhere else. Medusa already has standards for defining data models, custom business logic, and much more, all while being flexible and easy to work with. Instead of reinventing these standards, Medusa users can focus on defining the logic that gives customers the best experience and optimizes operations.\n\n## Build custom digital commerce applications faster\n\nMedusa 2.0 doubles down on ensuring Medusa is the best foundation for building custom digital commerce applications. This is achieved through a focus on supporting custom workflows involving multiple systems directly in Medusa. Today's digital commerce happens with help from different systems, whether point solutions, marketing tools, ERP systems, or custom-built internal systems. With many tools in a stack, a key challenge becomes aligning them and making them work together. Most tools and services have APIs and say they are composable. But they can merely only participate in a composable stack. No tool, except Medusa, helps businesses easily build the foundation for such a stack. And with Medusa 2.0, we will continue to make this much easier.\n\nTwo key changes in Medusa’s architecture will address this:\n\n1.  We will make core commerce concepts like Products, Discounts, etc., pluggable so you can use Medusa’s APIs without necessarily having to use Medusa’s full commerce module suite.\n\n2.  We will launch a new, powerful Workflow primitive to orchestrate modules and services to complete tasks in your digital commerce stack.\n\nThe outcome is that Medusa becomes a hub where your company’s systems can interact. With Medusa’s customization tools, it will be straightforward to build integrations, customer experiences, or internal business workflows from that central hub.\n\n## Making Medusa's modules pluggable\n\nMedusa's architecture has, from the beginning, been modular. The main Medusa package ships with a service for handling products, another for handling carts, another for handling discounts, and so on. The services provide great separation of concerns and make it easy to use them in customizations. All services, however, must run within the same server and database. This is not bad in itself, but it requires that Medusa stores a copy of your data from across your tools internally to make its features work. We are eliminating this dependency and thereby making Medusa pluggable with existing tools.  For example, if you have product data in an existing PIM system, you can integrate it deeply with Medusa. When a customer adds a product to their cart, we will fetch product information directly from the PIM system, and you can set up tax and discount rules for the products despite them not being part of Medusa's database.\n\n![](/images/old-new.jpg)\n\nWe are moving services into standalone packages like `@medusajs/product` and `@medusajs/pricing` to achieve this. These modules work independently of the rest of Medusa and can be used within any Node environment, including compatible serverless runtimes. Simultaneously, within the Medusa package, we are defining interfaces to the modules to make Medusa's default API work with the new standalone modules. This work happens behind the `medusa_v2` feature flag.\n\n## New primitives for building digital commerce flows\n\nSoon, we will introduce Workflows -  a new, powerful primitive for digital commerce applications with Workflows. A Workflow is a sequence of queries and actions across your system that achieve a task. Medusa will ship a wide range of Workflows to create products, add to a cart, and other operations available in Medusa’s API today.\n\nWorkflows are customizable, so you can inject custom logic into core workflows. For example, you can run custom validation when customers update their shipping addresses. Or add rules governing who can add given products to a cart. Or create a product entry in your CMS system whenever a new product is created.\n\nGiven that Medusa may be mutating data in external systems - like a PIM for your product data - we are building error handling into Workflows. Medusa will automatically retry failed attempts to update data, and if the issue is permanent, Medusa’s Workflows will compensate for any previous data changes that may have happened.\n\n![](/images/add-to-cart.jpg)\n\nDevelopers will also be able to create custom Workflows, which opens the door for a broad range of use cases and makes Medusa the best place to build integrations between your systems.\n\nConsider integrating purchase orders from your ERP with your warehouse management system's inbounds. You can easily build custom services for your ERP and WMS and then construct a workflow that processes the purchase order and forwards it to the WMS. Doing this through Medusa creates opportunities for better customer experiences, like decorating products with an expected restock date for your customers to know when their favorite product will become available. This is easy because your product data is readily available through Medusa. Additionally, with the workflows, you won't have to worry about stale data between systems as retries and compensations are built-in. This is just one example of how custom Workflows can be used. As you add more connections between systems in your stack and Medusa, the opportunities for what is possible with Workflows expand exponentially.\n\n![](/images/medusa-connecter-76bb3996.jpg)\n\n## A great toolbox for digital commerce applications\n\nThe Workflow primitive joins Medusa’s existing tools like API Routes for custom API request handlers, Admin Extensions to build dashboard UI extensions, EventBus and Subscribers for Pub/Sub, Services for custom business logic and connections to external systems, and, of course, Medusa’s commerce logic for core commerce functionality.\n\nMedusa comes packed with many great defaults that would take years for internal teams in digital commerce businesses to build and even more effort to continue to improve. With Workflows and Medusa 2.0, we will lower the bar for adopting Medusa into your stack. You can, for instance, start using Medusa’s Workflows to integrate your systems and, at your own pace, adopt the commerce modules that make sense for you.\n\nIt’s important to note that while the architectural changes we have planned will enable more complex use cases, Medusa will still be simple to set up. Our default API will have minimal breaking changes, and we are committed to making the upgrade path for existing Medusa projects smooth and painless.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nOver the next couple of months, we will ship many new standalone commerce modules. Each of them will be a key milestone toward shipping Medusa 2.0, and we are excited to hear your feedback and inputs as they are made available.\n\nYou can expect our Workflows to be released very soon. The Workflow tools can be used independently of Medusa 2.0, so you will not have to wait long before using this new, powerful primitive.

With our commerce primitives and tooling, developers can effortlessly build unique digital commerce applications at record speed.\n\n## **API Routes**\n\nAPI Routes in Medusa is a place for developers to add custom logic that HTTP requests can trigger. The endpoints have direct access to Medusa’s core services like the Product and Cart services and custom services added to your project or in installed plugins.\n\nTo create a custom endpoint in Medusa, developers have had to familiarize themselves with application routing and Express more generally. This created friction unrelated to our product, leading to frustration from users, the community, and our support team.\n\nToday, we are introducing API Routes - drastically simplifying creating custom endpoints in Medusa.\n\nDevelopers can now create custom routes using simple JavaScript without worrying about the intricacies of the Express Router. Routes are registered using the file system, an approach familiar to many from frameworks like Next.js and Svelte.\n\n```ts\n// api/admin/products/route.ts\nimport { MedusaRequest, MedusaResponse } from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\n\nexport async function GET(req: MedusaRequest, res: MedusaResponse) {\n\tconst productService = req.scope.resolve(\"productService\")\n\n\tconst products = await productService.list()\n\n\tres.json({ products })\n}\n```\n\nThe example above illustrates a few key points of API Routes:\n\n*   Endpoint paths are inferred from the file path\n\n*   `route.{ts|js}` is a special file that contains the router handlers\n\n*   HTTP methods are defined by the route handler name; here `GET`\n\nIn the example above, we register a `GET` route at path `/admin/products`.\n\n### **Dynamic Segments**\n\nAPI Routes support dynamic URL segments and are similarly registered through the file system.\n\n```ts\n// api/admin/products/[id]/route.ts\n\nimport { MedusaRequest, MedusaResponse } from \"@medusajs/medusa\"\n\nexport async function POST(req: MedusaRequest, res: MedusaResponse) {\n  const { id } = req.params\n\tconst { payload } = req.body\n\n\tconst productService = req.scope.resolve(\"productService\")\n\n\tconst product = await productService.update(id, payload)\n\n\tres.json({ product })\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, we register a `POST` route at path `/admin/products/:id`. The brackets in the file path, `api/admin/products/[id]/route.ts`, specify a parameter that can be accessed within the handler.\n\nYou can add as many dynamic segments as you’d like. However, if the parameter names clash, an error will be thrown, and your application will terminate.\n\n### **Middlewares**\n\nAdding middleware to routes has also been simplified. With API Routes, we are centralizing all middlewares in a file at `api/middlewares.{ts|js}`. In this file, you can register middleware to all endpoints, a subset of endpoints, or one at a time.\n\n```ts\n// api/middlewares.ts\n\nexport const config: MiddlewaresConfig = {\n  routes: [\n    {\n      method: [\"GET\", \"POST\"],\n      matcher: \"/store/*\",\n      middlewares: [someStoreMiddleware],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nPer default, middleware is registered globally. The `matcher` option is required to configure the paths the middlewares apply to. The `method` option is used to configure the specific methods the middlewares apply to.\n\nIn the example above, we register a middleware, `someStoreMiddleware`, to all paths starting with `/store` that use HTTP methods `GET` and `POST`.\n\n## **What’s next?**\n\nWe are excited to hear your thoughts about our new API Routes. If you have any feedback or experience issues, don’t hesitate to post on our GitHub Issues board or GitHub Discussions.\n\nIn the future, we plan to extend the `MedusaRequest` and `MedusaResponse` to offer an even better experience with access to types specific to our Request and Response context, such as the Awilix dependency container living at `req.scope`.\n\nTrack our progress on [X](https://twitter.com/medusajs) and in our [changelog](https://medusajs.com/changelog/).\n"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[[...slug]]","query":{"slug":["blog"]},"buildId":"zjc-qhpUCOoFu0LE2b9B4","isFallback":false,"dynamicIds":[52135,62749],"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
